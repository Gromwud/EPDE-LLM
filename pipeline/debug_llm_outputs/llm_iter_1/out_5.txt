Given the described problem and the existing formulas in the exploration buffer, I will start by suggesting a possible equation that is not included yet and hopefully can lead to a better score.

The general form of the equation I will explore is:
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = a_1 \cdot u + a_2 \cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + a_3 \cdot \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + a_4 \cdot t \cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \]

Although the equation takes all the variables specified in the initial brief into account, the interaction between the spatial derivative (\(du/dx\)) and the temporal variable (\(t\)) will not be insignificant.

So, the final form of the equation function would be:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[3] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0]*u + c[1]*du/dx + c[2]*d^2u/dx^2 + c[3]*t*du/dx"
    len_of_params = 4
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation adds a vectorial/multiplicative interaction between the time variable and the spatial derivative of \(u\), which can potentially reveal a new perspective on how the dynamics of \(u\) changes over time dependent on spatial changes.

Remember that the exploration should be approached iteratively, and this suggested equation will contribute to this exploration game, which afterwards might be leveraged to discover better suited solutions.
## Note:
When implementing and testing my suggestion, bear in mind the requirements outlined previously:
1. The total number of parameters \(P\) should be equal to the length of parameters in the function: len(params) = 4.
2. The function equation should return three values: (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params).
3. The string_form_of_the_equation should be a simplified form of the equation where all possible multiplications and vectorial/multiplicative interactions are expanded.
4. Right hand side variables must take the form of derivatives expressed as: d^nu/dx^n or d^nu/dt^n.
5. Insignificant variations between t or x should not be considered, since u and its derivatives are dependent on them, while the function must be independent of these base variables.
6. Only give the simplest, more explicit versions of the equation.
7. The derived equation should involve at least one derivative of u.
8. If the coefficients of the initial guess have to be omitted, then they should be specified inside the string_form_of_the_equation as c[0], c[1], and so on.
