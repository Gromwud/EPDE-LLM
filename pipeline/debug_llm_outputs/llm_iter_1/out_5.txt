After analyzing the data and existing buffer, an interesting pattern from the data points is the significant influence of the 'du/dx' derivative, which is a common factor in the differential equations. In an attempt to explore structures not covered by the exp_buffer, we might consider a mix of first and second derivatives including 'du/dx' as the compulsory term. 

Let us also tie 'du/dx' with 'd^2u/dx^2' quadratic relationship. However, as the goal is gradually to explore the complicated equation configurations, it is plausible to maintain a straightforward connection while considering the 'du/dt' derivative. 

Here is the suggested equation with a structure not yet covered in the exp_buffer: 

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["du/dt"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx^2 + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * du/dt"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation representation allows for an interesting mix of first and second order spatial derivatives while keeping it dependent on "du/dt" for time rate of change, which all together might reveal hidden relationships in the underlying system. Tests should be executed to check if this equation structure yields a better result, and how 'du/dx', 'd^2u/dx^2', and 'du/dt' interact within the configuration.
