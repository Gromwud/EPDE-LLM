Given the complex nature of the question and the provided data, constructing an equation that hasn't been attempted before based on the equations in 'exp_buffer' can be a challenging task. The information provided in the input data suggests that there are several variables and derivatives involved in the system. The solution to this problem will offer a new equation that accounts for at least one derivative, as per the guidelines.

We can attempt constructing an equation that is relatively simple yet includes a derivative:

Let's construct an equation using du/dt, du/dx, d^2u/dx^2 with addtional factor t or x to explore interactions with respect to time and spatial dimensions:

```python
P = 3
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # Construct the equation using du/dt, du/dx, d^2u/dx^2 and t or x
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    # Prepare the string output of the equation
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * du/dt * du/dx"
    len_of_params = P
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation, du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * du/dt * du/dx, includes a derivative (du/dx) multiplied by a constant c[0], a second order spatial derivative (d^2u/dx^2) multiplied by a constant c[1] and time t, and the derivative du/dt multiplied by another derivative du/dx with constant c[2]. The equation has not been previously attempted according to the 'exp_buffer' data, so it complies with all conditions given in the problem statement.

**Note:** This type of problem is often encountered in scientific simulations and data-driven modeling (such as physics-informed machine learning). The idea is to fit a partial differential equation to data, which can be particularly challenging due to the many possible forms a PDE can take. Without knowledge of the true underlying physical process, finding the correct PDE from data alone is akin to making a well-informed guess - and thus often referred to as reverse engineering the physical laws.
