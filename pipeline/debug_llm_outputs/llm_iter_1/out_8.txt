Given the problem description, input data, and the examples of unexplored equations in the `exp_buffer`, we need to create an equation that depends on at least one derivative and is not present in the `exp_buffer`. The equation's dependence on `du/dx` is explicitly mentioned in the requirements, so, in our construction, we guarantee that `du/dx` is included.

To improve the equation presented so far, one could consider incorporating terms that involve the second derivative with respect to `x` (`d^2u/dx^2`) and potentially combinations of derivatives with quantities like `u` or `du/dx`. The equation's dependence on `du/dx` is explicitly mentioned in the requirements, so, in our construction, we should guarantee that `du/dx` is included but we can also explore interactions with other quantities such as `u`.

To accomplish this and create unexplored space, considering terms that combine these derivatives could provide an expanded perspective on the equations that might govern the behavior under investigation:

Taking inspiration from the unexplored equation in `exp_buffer` and the instructions:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[3] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[3] * u * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 4
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```

The equation constructed this way ensures that we meet the requirement of using at least one derivative (`du/dx`) and, in this case, also incorporates the second derivative with respect to `x` and the interaction of `u` with `du/dx`. This new equation does not match any equations from the `exp_buffer` and thus can be considered as alternative unexplored space. Note that the incorporation of `u` and `u * du/dx` allows us to observe their potential implications and interactions that might affect `du/dt` differently, contributing to a potentially more comprehensive understanding of the phenomena's nature.
