Based on the simplified structure du/dt = c[0] * du/dx that you proposed, you can construct the function as follows:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    c = params[0]
    right_side = c * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = {c:.2f} * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

In this function, the constant c is multiplied by the x derivative of u (du/dx) to compute the right side of the equation. The equation string is then created with the format of "du/dt = {c:.2f} * du/dx" where {c:.2f} represents the floating point number c formatted to have 2 decimal points. The length of the parameter array is returned as well to keep track of the number of parameters used in the equation.
However, it is better to create a list of possible equations and test them one by one in terms of the loss function,

```python
possible_equations = [
    lambda params: params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"],  # du/dx impact
    lambda params: params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"],  # d^2u/dx^2 impact
    lambda params: params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"],  # d^2u/dt^2 impact
    lambda params: params[0] * u,  # u impact
    lambda params: params[0] * x,  # x impact
    lambda params: params[0] * t,  # t impact
]

complete_loss = []
for eq_function in possible_equations:
    loss = loss_function(params, t, x, u, derivs_dict)
    complete_loss.append(loss)

optimized_eq = list(enumerate(complete_loss))
optimized_eq.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

final_eq = possible_equations[optimized_eq[0][0]]
best_loss = optimized_eq[0][1]

# evaluate with the best equation
best_answer = evaluate({"inputs": (t,x,u), "derivs_dict": derivs_dict})
```

In this way, we can empirically determine which derivative or which variable has a higher impact on du/dt.

Be aware that following this routine could lead to an insufficient explanation of data and potentially large errors. The choice of simple structure is usually a pragmatic decision made due to availability of numerical optimization methods and the likelihood of noise in the data. A more complex structure could provide a more accurate fit, but at the cost of more parameters which can lead to overfitting the data. Ultimately, the choice of structure should be made based on physical considerations and robust statistical testing. 

The best way to determine appropriate structure for the problem would be to construct several such functions (each assuming distinct relationships between du/dt and its independent variables) and compare their semantics and fit to the data using Mean Square Error (MSE) or a similar statistical test. This would involve NumPy methods, matlab methods, or callable objects from scipy. This is beyond the capabilities of this bot currently. 

The optimal decision can then be made based on balancing simplicity (the Occam's Razor principle) and a good fit to the data (minimizing the loss function).
