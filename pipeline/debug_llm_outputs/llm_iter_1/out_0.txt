To approximate the provided data with a simple model, let us consider a linear relationship between `du/dt` and `du/dx`. This is a plausible choice given the presence of the `du/dx` term in the large set of differential terms available.  As a first approximation, we might set:
$$
\frac{du}{dt} = c[0] \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
$$

Let's build `equation_v1` that models the dynamics of `u` as a function of the derivatives `du/dx`. 

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # The 'right_side' of the equation represents the rate of change of 'u' with respect to 't'.
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    # The 'string_form_of_the_equation' is the string representation of the equation for readability.
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = {params[0]} * du/dx"
    # The 'len_of_params' is the length of the 'params' array.
    len_of_params = len(params)
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```

This function `equation_v1` implements the basic model of `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx`. Here the `params[0]` is the constant of proportionality between `du/dt` and `du/dx`. For the simplicity's sake, we can assume that `du/dt = du/dx` at initial stage calculation and adjust this factor `params[0]` based on the optimization algorithm that minimizes the function `loss_function` over.

In this equation, the variables `t` and `x` remain present in the call to `equation_v1` for consistency and generality, but they do not explicitly influence the computation of `du/dt` under this chosen framework.
