Taking into account the requirements of the task, the information from the 'exp_buffer', and the complexity of the problem, I will propose a function that involves variables and derivatives not yet explored in the 'exp_buffer'. An equation that might fit the data could be of the form 'du/dt = c[0] * u + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * du/dx^2 + c[3] * d^2u/dx^2'. This incorporates u, which indicates an dependency on position (x) and time (t), the first derivative du/dx which might relate the rate of change in the x-direction, the second power of du/dx following the suggestion to explore inexplicit interactions (in this case the square of the gradient), and finally d^2u/dx^2 relating to the curvature (or second derivative in the x direction).

Here is the relevant python code:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] +
        params[2] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2) + params[3] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * (du/dx)**2 + c[3] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 4
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
The string form of the equation is open-bracketed and the terms are simplified as the instructions suggest. This proposed form is not present in 'exp_buffer' and can be tested for accuracy. 

Please note that this is a guess based on the given information, and the actual equation might contain more or less parameters, different interactions among the variables, and different orders of derivatives. Make sure to run your evaluation with this suggested equation as it is only a supposition based on the problem description.
