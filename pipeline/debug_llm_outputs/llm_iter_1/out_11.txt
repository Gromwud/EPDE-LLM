Here is a proposal for an equation based on the provided points_set and taking into account the exp_buffer, where we aim to avoid proposing already tested equation structures. We'll go for a simple yet not yet tested structure considering the influence of `du/dx` and `u`:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
In this proposed structure, `u` and `du/dx` are considered as a product and scaled by `c[0]`, introducing a possible nonlinear relation not previously explored in the exp_buffer.
