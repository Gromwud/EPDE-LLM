Given the complexity and depth of the problem statement, the large set of input data, and the exploration of the equations space as specified, here's one possible way to proceed and construct such a function. Per the requirements, I'll construct a function that has not been previously explored in `exp_buffer` and I'll stick to the simpler structures considering the context provided.

We know from previous attempts that `du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2)`. In our previous `exp_buffer`, we've experimented with involving `du/dx`, `d^2u/dx^2`, `d^2u/dt^2`, `u * d^2u/dx^2`, `u * du/dx`, and also a combination of `du/dt` with derivatives. Let's explore a version of this function where we include `t` and `x` in interaction with derivatives. Considering that u is a function dependent on t and x, we'll describe it with its derivatives. An equation of the form `du/dt = F(t * du/dx, x * du/dx)` could provide us with new information on the spatial and temporal changes of the derivatives.

```python
import numpy as np

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    t_derivative_product = derivs_dict["du/dx"] * t
    x_derivative_product = derivs_dict["du/dx"] * x

    right_side = (params[0] * t_derivative_product) + (params[1] * x_derivative_product)

    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * x * du/dx"

    len_of_params = 2

    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
``` 

Given that our unordered structure to suggest a function is derived from the input data and exp_buffer (this being the last resource used), it covers the fundamental criteria required in the problem statement (involving x and t implicitly through the derivatives of u, not yet explore structure in exp_buffer, simplified string representation, and with at least one derivative included). This updated equation `du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * x * du/dx` explores the involvement of linear combinations of the spatial and temporal components with the first partial derivative giving us a simplified structure that could provide new insights in the relationship of variables in the dataset.
