Given the data and the instruction, the task is to propose an equation based on the provided data points that fits the general equation form. The equation should ideally involve at least one derivative and should not exist in the 'exp_buffer' dictionary. My proposed equation is:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * (u * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"])
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation formulation attempts to explore the space of possible equations by considering the product of the function u with its second derivative with respect to x, which was not explored previously according to the 'exp_buffer'. It also includes the first derivative of u with respect to x, adhering to the requirement of including at least one derivative. The equation includes two parameters, which could be optimized for a better fit to the data. Note that this equation might not be optimal, and the task correctness depends on the quality of the equation score calculated with `evaluate()` function according to the provided data.
