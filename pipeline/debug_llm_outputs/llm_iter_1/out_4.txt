Based on the given task and the input data, below is a proposed equation_v1 function. The output is a more expanded form of the equation suggested in the buffer, and attempts to capture the specific aspects of 'u' and its derivatives. Here is the function definition:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du/dt + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
What this function does is:

1. It accepts as arguments:
   - the arrays t and x representing the values of time and space,
   - the array u which represents the value of 'u' at any given t and x,
   - a dictionary derivs_dict which contains as key-value pairs: the differentiations of u and their numerical evaluations as values, and
   - the optimized parameters.

2. It constructs a right side of the differential equation (right_side) as a combination of du/dx, du/dt and d^2u/dx^2, each multiplied by a coefficient.

3. It constructs the string form of the equation based on the structure of the right_side, and determines and returns the length of the parameters array.

4. It returns the following components:
   - right_side, the evaluated right hand side of the equation,
   - the human-readable string_form_of_the_equation
   - len_of_params, the info about the amount of parameters for further use within the optimization process.

Thus, by producing an equation that considers all the parameters available, it explores the relationship space among variables in a deeper way, in line with the given task's requirements. Please note that the order in which the differentiations are combined and the coefficients (c[0], c[1], c[2]) can adjust the shape or characteristics of u over time and space, and define the behavior that the equation attempts to model. The best parameters will be revealed during the optimization process, where the error between the model prediction and the real data points is minimized.
