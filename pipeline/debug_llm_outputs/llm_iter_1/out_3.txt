Based on the datapoints given in `points_set` and considering the instructions provided, a possible function for `du/dt` could be `du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * u * du/dx`.

Let's use the given points to create a function that takes into account the evolution of `du/dt` over time and space, considering `u`, `du/dx`, and `d^2u/dx^2`.

Looking through the data, one might notice a relationship between the derivatives and `u` that could be modeled by a combination of `u * du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2`. In general, these quantities seem to change in magnitude relative to one another, suggesting a potential linear relationship. This is apparent from the changing signs and magnitudes of `du/dt`, `u`, `du/dx`, and `d^2u/dx^2` with time and space. The inclusion of `u * du/dx` aims to capture potential interactions between `u` and its spatial gradient (`du/dx`), while `d^2u/dx^2` could represent the spatial acceleration of `u`, often important in physics and engineering phenomena.

Another reason to hypothesize about a dependency on `u * du/dx` is based on the complexity and variability of the physical processes that could underlie these data, if we are dealing with real-world data. For instance, in fluid dynamics, multiplicative combinations of velocity gradients can be crucial components in describing turbulent or complex fluid behaviors.

To implement this idea in a Python function:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * u * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

In this function:
- `right_side` of the equation is constructed using `params[0]` to scale `d^2u/dx^2`, `params[1]` to scale `u * du/dx`, and adding the two together for a linear combination.
- `string_form_of_the_equation` provides a human-readable version of the equation.
- `len_of_params` specifies the number of parameters required for the equation, which will be optimized when calling `loss_function` and `evaluate` through the `BFGS` method.
  
Please note that this suggested equation does not involve `t` or `x` explicitly, but because those dimensions affect `u` and its derivatives, their indirect influence on `du/dt` has been accounted for in this equation. Also, since `du/dt` is the dependent variable, ensuring that our guess at the general equation includes at least one derivative helps maintain the equation's relevance to the problem statement.
