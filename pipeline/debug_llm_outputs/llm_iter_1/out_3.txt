Given the experimental results in the buffer, a possible equation that meets the problem's demands and isn't listed there could take a form that incorporates higher-order derivatives, in conjunction with some lower-order terms. Here's an equation following that description:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    P = 2
    right_side = (params[0]*derivs_dict["du/dx"]) + (params[1]*derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"])
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = P
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

The score for this equation can be then calculated using the 'evaluate' function, which will utilize the 'points_set' data for parameter optimization and then evaluate the equation, making sure the parameters are valid.

Note: In the presented equation, two parameters 'c[0]' and 'c[1]' are used to adjust the relative importance of 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2' in the solution respectively. To ensure that this expression hasn't been used previously, please confirm it doesn't appear in the 'exp_buffer' dictionary from your UI.
