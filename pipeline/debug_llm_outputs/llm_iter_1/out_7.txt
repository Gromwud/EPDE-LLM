Considering the exploration history stored in `exp_buffer`, we've determined the Duhamel's principle which dictates that the action at a particular point in space should only be affected by the past and not the future. It signifies that if the space variable 'x' is present in the equation, it should be accompanied by a time derivative. The equation u_t = c[0] * u_x, which suggests the diffusion of 'u' over 'x' at a constant rate 'c[0]', is a simple pattern we've explored. We've also extended this exploration to include the second-order spatial derivative (u_xx), which portrays the curvature of 'u' with respect to 'x', and (u_x)^2, reflecting intensity of 'u' change in 'x'.

Further exploration has indeed yielded more complex expressions involving 't', while 'x' still appears to be implicitly defined through 'u' and its derivatives. Highest exploration score was achieved by the equation integrating 'u', its first derivative 'u_x', second derivative 'u_xx', and 't'. Following Duhamel's principle and complexity exploration sequence, our next exploration should include 'u', 'u_x', 'u_xx', and 'u_t' (indicating change of 'u' in time), with 't' reflected through 'u' or its derivatives.

Considering above insights, we propose the equation integrating 'u', its first derivative 'u_x', and 'u_t' (indicating change of 'u' in time):

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["du/dt"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * du/dt"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This new equation incorporates 'u', 'u_x', and 'u_t', allowing exploration of how 'u' changes over time and with respect to 'x', incorporating the effect of 't' directly through the derivative 'u_t', and is different from prior explorations as it includes 'du/dt' and 'u' which have not been simultaneously used before.
