After analyzing the provided data points and exploring the space of equations as suggested, a possible function that could describe the dataset is given by:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dt + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * t * du/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

The equation `du/dt = c[0] * du/dt + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * t * du/dx^2` has not been explored in the exp_buffer dictionary, which means this structure and its parameters have yet to be evaluated with the evaluate function.
The evaluation is achieved by setting a loss function that compares the right side of the equation evaluated with the dataset's du/dt to the dataset's actual du/dt. The parameters are optimized using this loss function, then these optimized parameters are further evaluated to obtain a score using the evaluate function.
Note that this proposed equation includes higher-order derivatives (d^2u/dx^2) and the second-order term du/dx^2, addressing the task requirement to investigate inexplicit interactions between input variables and higher-order derivatives. The equation also incorporates the variable t, which is involved through the term `c[2] * t * du/dx^2` to explore its potential influence on the dynamics described by the dataset.
