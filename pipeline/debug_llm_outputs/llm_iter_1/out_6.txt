After analyzing the provided points set and the exploration buffer, I propose the following equation form:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * derivs_dict["u"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * u"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This equation is different from the ones in the buffer, and it incorporates both 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2' in relation with 'u'. This was not explored yet and may reveal an unidentified interaction. Let's check how well our equation describes our data with this function.
