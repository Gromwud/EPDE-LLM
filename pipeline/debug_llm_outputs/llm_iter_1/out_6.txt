Based on the instructions and data provided, we're trying to find a differential equation du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2) that best fits the given point set. The previous attempts, represented in exp_buffer, provide insight on what has already been tried and the scores they achieved, guiding us on what to explore next.

Let's introduce a hypothesis that considers the involvement of 'du/dx' but with more complex interactions with the other derivatives. Given that the current best scoring equation (in the example provided) is "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du/dt + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2" with a score of 0.337, it indicates there might be some relationship between the derivatives beyond a linear combination.

A potentially interesting structure might include interactions between 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2', or perhaps 'du/dt' squared. Given that neither 't' nor 'x' seem to show explicit involvement based on the described dataset and past equations, we will focus on 'u' and its derivatives. 

Here's an updated equation to explore. This time, we will consider the influence of 'du/dx' squared and 'd^2u/dx^2', which might help us capture the complex nature of the underlying physics:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = (params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]) + (params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"])
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = {params[0]} * d^2u/dx^2 + {params[1]} * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = len(params)
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation introduces a quadratic term based on the first derivative 'du/dx', and it adds a term that linearly scales the second derivative with respect to 'x'. This structure is not yet covered in the previous attempts (judging from the exp_buffer), and by including the du/dx squared term, it allows us to explore potential nonlinear dependencies in our dataset. This equation also enforces our requirement of including at least one derivative term, specifically 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2' in this case.
