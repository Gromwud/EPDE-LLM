Based on the data points provided, let's look for a possible equation involving at least one derivative. The suggestion would be to make use of multiple derivative factors, seeing as the task guide explicitly points towards looking for "inexlicit interactions". For that purpose, we will use `d^2u/dx^2` and `du/dt` to see if they can drive a correlation.

Since this equation needs to describe the system represented by du/dt, we can structurally introduce `du/dt` in the equation. For an examples's sake, let's multiply it with a constant term `c[0]`. Moreover, let's add `d^2u/dx^2` multiplied with a constant `c[1]`, to see if the second derivative has an effect. To enhance the equation's structure, we also incorporate a component that comprises the interaction between `x` and `du/dx` multiplied by a constant `c[2]` to account for any potential interaction effects.

Given that, let's create an equation `equation_v1` with the components explained above.
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * x * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dt + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * x * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
Note that this equation's string form is in line with the task's examples: all brackets are opened (no implicit multiplications), and for higher derivatives, I used `d^2u/dx^2` and `du/dt` notation, as required. Additionally, this right-side equation is composed of at least one derivative, `du/dt`, and, depending on the parameters' values, could theoretically simplify to another derivative model, `du/dt = c * du/dt`.

Your next step would be to optimize this function with the `loss_function` and then evaluate it with the `evaluate` function using the provided simulation data.
