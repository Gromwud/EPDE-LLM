Based on the data provided and the exploration thus far, it seems worth exploring the relationship between du/dt, du/dx, and d^2u/dx^2, especially as it was not explicitly explored with multiplication or interaction terms in the 'exp_buffer'. We will construct a hypothesis which includes both du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, and suggests a relationship where du/dt may be influenced not just by du/dx, but also by how the rate of change in du/dx (i.e., d^2u/dx^2) changes, multiplied by some constant.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

By suggesting this equation `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * du/dx`, we are exploring the interplay between the first and second derivatives of u with respect to x, not directly explored in the previous iterations. This adds an additional layer of complexity in our search for inexplicit interactions between the variables.
