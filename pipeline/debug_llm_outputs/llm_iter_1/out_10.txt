To construct a new function for the given data set that isn't already listed in the exp_buffer and maintaining the consideration for reducing complexity initially before moving onto more complex functions, let's explore simpler structures based on the function's dependency on derivatives which haven't been explored in the exp_buffer yet. 

Since the exploration in exp_buffer mostly focused on `du/dx` and higher-order derivatives `d^2u/dx^2`, `du/dt` combined in various ways, and the interaction with `u`, `t`, `x`, let's explore the use of `d^2u/dt^2` which hasn't been combined with other derivatives in a similar form as presented in the exp_buffer.

An interesting starting point is the relationship between the second derivative w.r.t time combined with `du/dx`:

Let's propose:

`du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dt^2`

The interpreted structure of this equation is that the rate of change of `u` with respect to `t` could be associated with both the spatial gradient `du/dx` and the temporal acceleration `d^2u/dt^2`.

Here is how one might write a function that conforms to this suggested structure:

```python
def equation_v1(t, x, u, derivs_dict, params):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

### Usage:

The function `equation_v1` takes as inputs arrays of time `t`, position `x`, solution `u`, a dictionary of derivatives `derivs_dict`, and an array of parameters `params`. The function returns a tuple containing the computed right side of the proposed equation, a string representing the equation, and the length of how many parameters are included in the equation (in this case, 2 parameters are used). The decision to combine `du/dx` and `d^2u/dt^2` mainly focuses on exploring the roles of spatial variation and acceleration in time.

Remember to check the score given this equation by employing the `evaluate` function, and this could help discover whether the unexplored relationship between `du/dx` and `d^2u/dt^2` reveals significant features in the data not yet captured by other equations. This could also indicate valuable interdependence between spatial changes and temporal dynamics.
