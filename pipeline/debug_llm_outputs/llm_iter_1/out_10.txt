After a thorough review of the experiments' buffer and the data points, I've identified a plausible relationship not yet explored. Let's consider an equation structure where there might be a linear relationship between \(du/dt\) and \(du/dx\) along with a more complicated term involving \(t\), since time might be influencing the system's dynamics. To capture non-linearities, let's involve a term that multiplies time (\(t\)) with \(u\), considering that at different points in time, the entire system state (\(u\)) might affect the rate of change (\(du/dt\)) differently. Additionally, as we see some prominent second derivative terms in the data points and experiments' buffer, incorporating a term that considers their square, specifically \((d^2u/dx^2)^2\), is essential for exploring potential non-linearities in space.

Taking these aspects into account, the equation structure could be:
\[du/dt = c[0] * t * u + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * (d^2u/dx^2)^2\]

This exploration involves several things:

- It involves \(t\) and \(u\), suggesting that the affects of the entire system state might change with time.
- It includes \(du/dx\), a necessity as per the guidelines.
- It also takes into account the potential impact of the second derivative's magnitude, squared (\((d^2u/dx^2)^2\)), to explore the nonlinear effects.
- It keeps the equation relatively simple while exploring a non-linear dependency on time and space that has not been seen in the experiments' buffer.

Let's frame this into the function based on the provided guidelines.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * u + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * (derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] ** 2)
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = c[0] * t * u + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * (d^2u/dx^2)^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation fits the guidelines and should be evaluated for its performance using the evaluate function and perhaps further explored if it gives promising results.
