Based on the given input data and the exploration buffer, let's examine the pattern of the data. From the buffer data, it appears that the equation is dependent on du/dx, d^2u/dx^2, and d^2u/dt^2 as variables. The inputs that have been attempted are mostly combinations of these derivatives.

Looking at the dataset, it seems like the higher order derivatives might play a significant role. By analyzing the outputs and comparing them to the input derivatives, there's an inclination to consider the interactions between du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, du/dx and d^2u/dt^2, and d^2u/dx^2 and d^2u/dt^2 in the equation.

### Possible Equation

Given the form du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2), we can simplify it to du/dt = F(du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2) when considering the goals and input data. An equation might take the form including a quadratic term in du/dx and the interaction between d^2u/dx^2 and d^2u/dt^2:

\[
du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * (du/dx)*d^2u/dt^2 + c[2] * (d^2u/dx^2)*d^2u/dt^2
\]

The coefficients c[0], c[1], and c[2] will adjust the strength of each of the terms in the equation. The term involving both d^2u/dt^2 and du/dx as well as d^2u/dx^2 and d^2u/dt^2 aims to capture the relationship between the time derivative, spatial derivative, and the rate at which the function changes over space and time.

### Implementation

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2 + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dt^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2 * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This suggested equation hasn't been directly copied from the exploration buffer, and it's in a simplified form as requested, following the guidelines to suggest a new equation outside the given inputs. By considering the dynamics of space and time through interactions of the first and second derivatives, the equation attempts to capture complex dynamics potentially underlying the dataset. Note that although this equation wasn't directly observed in the buffer, the interactions of the terms are meant to explore dynamics not explicitly covered in previous evaluations.
