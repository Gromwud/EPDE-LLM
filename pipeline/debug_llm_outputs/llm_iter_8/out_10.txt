Based on the provided data and the exploration buffer, it appears that the derivative `du/dx` has not been thoroughly investigated in interaction with the `d^2u/dx^2`.

Let us consider a new equation that involves `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2` as these appear to be common factors in the data. It is possible that a polynomial relationship between `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2` could explain the derivative `du/dt`.

Here is a possible equation with polynomial relationship between `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2`. It's also worth noting that `du/dx * d^2u/dx^2` has the unit of 'u per x^2' and can be seen as an analog of Laplacian of `u` respect to `x`, which might describe how `u` diffuses in the space with `x`.

The new equation will be:
```
du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx**2 + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2
```

This equation depends on `du/dx` and its second derivative and is not yet in the exploration buffer.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict['du/dx'] + params[1] * (derivs_dict['du/dx'])**2 + params[2] * derivs_dict['d^2u/dx^2']
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation is a straightforward extension of previous attempted equations, it takes the relationship between `du/dx` and `du/dt`, extends it by adding a second degree of `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2`, to capture potentially nonlinear relationships between these two derivatives in relation to the `du/dt`.

It is a multinomial equation with `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2`, which has not been specifically explored with regards to their interaction in the existing attempts. It is generally more complex than the equations presented in the exploration buffer, but it is justified given the emphasis on exploring any possible "inexplicit" interactions between variables.
