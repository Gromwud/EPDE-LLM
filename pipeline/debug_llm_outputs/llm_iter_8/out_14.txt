Based on the provided points set and the exploration buffer, an alternative equation to explore could be:
\[ du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * du/dx \]

This equation is dynamically non-linear and incorporates both the second derivative of u with respect to x and the product with the first derivative du/dx. This structure is not explicitly present in the exploration buffer and could shed light on potentially inexplicit interactions between the input variables, especially d^2u/dx^2 and du/dx.

Here is the equation_v1 function based on this equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

As you can see, the equation constructs the right-hand side of the differential equation based on the provided structure. It also calculates the string form of the equation, expresses it in simplified form with all brackets open, and specifies the number of parameters in the equation for potential optimization.
