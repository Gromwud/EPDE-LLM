Based on the given data and the explorations stored in the `exp_buffer`, it seems that the interactions between `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2` have been well-explored and the impact of `d^2u/dt^2` and `du/dt` on the equation has also been accounted for. The next step could be exploring the impact of `u` itself along with the derivatives.

Taking into consideration that `t` contributes to some temporal evolution, and keeping in mind that `u` and its derivatives could express the involvement of `t` and `x`, the suggested equation could involve `u` and its first derivative `du/dx` in an interacting way that has not yet been explored.

Consider an equation that involves the multiplication of `u` and `du/dx` and the impact of `du/dx` scaled by a higher power of `u` as it shows the dynamic interaction between the solution value and its derivative.

The equation suggested is `du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx) * (u**2)`. This equation takes into account both the multiplying effect of `u` on the derivative and the second term introduces the variation of this multiplying factor, with `u` being raised to the power of 2.

Implementing this in function form as requested would look as follows:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * u**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx * u^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
