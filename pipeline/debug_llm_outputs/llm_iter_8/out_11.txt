To construct a suitable equation that is yet to be explored based on the given data points and score buffer, let's first analyze the previous attempts and try to find a pattern or a parameter set that might require further exploration. From the scores in `exp_buffer`, the equation "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dt^2" seems to have a moderate score (804), indicating some level of fit but not the best. Also, equations involving `(du/dx)^2` and `d^2u/dt^2` have been attempted and scored reasonably, suggesting that these components might add some meaningful interactions.

Considering that higher-order derivatives and powers of derivatives have been tried with decent results, we should attempt an equation that includes at least one derivative term in the form of a product with another derivative term, as it could capture the potential cross-correlation between these variables. 

We should also aim for an equation that hasn't been explored yet â€“ looking at the `exp_buffer`, we haven't attempted an equation that involves a product of `u` and a higher-order derivative of `u`; such a design can potentially reveal more complex interactions between the dependent variable `u` and its dynamics.

Lastly, we need to ensure the proposed equation aligns with the requirement that it must include at least one derivative term.

Let's construct a new equation that includes `du/dx`, `d^2u/dt^2`, and factors of `u` to find a novel interaction that hasn't been explored yet.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * u + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"] * u**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * u^2 * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation is not just simpler but also novel, as it has not been attempted before according to the buffer of previous experiences. We use `du/dx` weighted by `u` and `d^2u/dt^2` weighted by `u^2` to investigate nonlinear and potentially complex interactions among them. This proposal is in line with the instructions of starting from simpler structures. If a low score is obtained, it might not be worth exploring more intricate equations, though complex interactions between `u`, its derivatives, and the independent variables `t` and `x` could exist. 

The `equation_v1` includes both `u` and its first and second derivatives with respect to `t` as well as the cross product of `u` and the first derivative to show the coherence of dynamics in `u` itself across different times.

The final constructed equation as per specification is:
```
du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * u^2 * d^2u/dt^2
```
