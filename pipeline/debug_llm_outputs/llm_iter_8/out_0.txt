Based on the given data, it appears there's a relationship between the $ du/dt $ and $ du/dx $ derivatives where $ du/dt $ seems to closely approximate $ - du/dx $. This is evident from the fact that whenever $ du/dx $ is positive, $ du/dt $ appears to be negative, and vice versa.

Given this observation, our preliminary equation might approximate this differential relationship as:

$ du/dt = c * ( -du/dx) $ 

Where $c$ is a constant that we will optimize based on the points in the given dataset using a least squares minimization.

```python
# Define the equation_v1 based on the given data pattern
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    du_dx = derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    c = params[0]
    right_side = c * (-du_dx)             # the approximate eq relationship du/dt = c * -du/dx
    str_form_of_the_eq = f"du/dt = {c} * du/dx"         # string representation of the same eq
    num_params = 1                       # number of params used in the eq
    return right_side, str_form_of_the_eq, num_params
```

Here, $ params[0] $ represents the value of $c$ in the formula $ c * du/dx $.
Remember that this is a basic interpretaion based on the given data points, the real relationship might be more complex and involving other terms as well. One could use higher order polynomial fitting or machine learning modeling techniques for better approximation if needed. However, given the data at hand, this seems like a reasonable start for the preliminary exercise.
