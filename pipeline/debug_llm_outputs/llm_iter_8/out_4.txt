Based on the data and the exploration hints provided, let's explore a different construct for the equation that introduces the second derivative of u with respect to x, and the first derivative of u with respect to t, while ensuring each variable used is not explcitly present in the exp_buffer.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):

    # Define the right side of the differential equation and a string representation of it:
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] - params[2] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = c[0] * du/dt + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * du/dt - c[2] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    
    # Set the number of parameters (len_of_params) for the optimizer function
    len_of_params = 3

    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
``` 

This function represents the relationship suggested by the data with the usage of du/dt, d^2u/dx^2 and du/dx. This property should help in uncovering any hidden interactions between these variables that may have a significant influence on the overall trend of the dataset, even though such dependent varibles have not been explicitly used in the previous equations in the exp_buffer. The variables used are easily identifiable from the data set, and the string representation of the equation "du/dt = c[0] * du/dt + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * du/dt - c[2] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2" is not present in the exp_buffer.
