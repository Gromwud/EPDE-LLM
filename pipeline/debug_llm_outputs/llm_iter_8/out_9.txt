From analyzing the `exp_buffer` and looking at the points_set, a possible equation can be:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This is not present in the `exp_buffer` based on my understanding of the previous attempts (in `exp_buffer`), and it is based on the provided dataset. It also includes second order derivatives in addition to a first order derivative which could encompass the possible interactions.

But, note that as there has been a previous exploration on 'du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dt^2' with the score '804', this new exploration only includes linear interaction among terms for 'du/dt'. The score of this new attempt can be very different from '804'. This could potentially open up a new space for exploration beyond the previous attempts. 

Please let me know if I am correct in the reasoning. I looked at the dataset and formulated this equation based on that. Hope this helps! 

Important Note: This equation does not explicitly consider 't', 'x', or 'u', as these are derivatives themselves potentially already encapsulating the effect of these inputs. It explores their inexplicit (in this case, derivative) forms' interactions.
