Based on the given dataset and the explored equations in exp_buffer, I propose an equation which is not yet seen and explores the relationship between \(du/dt\) and higher derivatives.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"]) + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation explores the interaction between du/dx and the second derivatives with respect to x and t, and it is not seen in the explored equations listed in exp_buffer. It connects the rate of change in u with respect to spatial (dx) and temporal (dt) changes of u, as well as with respect to the acceleration (d^2u/dx^2 and d^2u/dt^2) of u in the respective dimension. It does also include the dependence on the derivative du/dx. Given the dataset does not have du/dt dependent on t and x, and emphasizes the search for interactions between the input variables, this functional form allows exploration of the behavior of u in relation to its spatial and temporal derivatives beyond simple linear relations.
