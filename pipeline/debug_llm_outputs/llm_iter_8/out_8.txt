In this suggested equation, I've included multiple derivative terms and interactions between them, ensuring that the equation is not a simple repeat of an existing one in the `exp_buffer` dictionary. Specifically, I've included terms with (du/dx) ^ 2, du/dx * d^2u/dx^2, d^2u/dt^2, and u * du/dx. By implementing this form of the equation and putting it through the evaluation process, we will explore a segment of the equations space that hasn't yet been covered by our previous explorations. And this equation does take into account the previous instructions, where we were advised to explore interactions between the input variables, including higher-order derivatives. As we aim for a possible equation that fits well with the series of points described, it's also important to consider the overall form of the equationâ€”our target is to find a potentially simplified form if it fits the data accurately, while making sure it is dependent on at least one derivative as was asked.
