Given the provided data and the previous attempts summarized in the `exp_buffer`, the following code proposes a new equation form that hasn't been evaluated before and may offer more insights into the behavior of the dataset. Given the complexity of the potential relationship and the requirement for exploration of higher-order derivatives and interactions, I suggest exploring an equation that includes a second-order derivative term and combines it with the first-order derivatives in a nonlinear fashion:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2 + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Justification for the choice:
1. This form allows us to explore if there are any significant interactions between the first derivative (`du/dx`) and the second spatial derivative (`d^2u/dx^2`). This choice is inspired by the previously attempted form "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2", which didn't consider the interaction between these two derivative terms.
2. To ensure that the equation does depend on at least one derivative as specified, we incorporate both first and second-order spatial derivatives (`du/dx`, `d^2u/dx^2`) and the second-order time derivative (`d^2u/dt^2`).
3. The choice of including `(du/dx)^2` is to explore potential nonlinear influences of the spatial gradient on the time rate of change, while the cross-term `(du/dx) * (d^2u/dx^2)` tests for anyCoordination between spatial gradient and concavity.
4. We also include the second-order time derivative (`d^2u/dt^2`) to explore potential acceleration influences on the rate of change. This is especially relevant in dynamic systems where acceleration may contribute significantly to changes.

This proposed form was not present in the `exp_buffer`, ensuring that we are exploring new theory space and potentially uncovering underlying structure in an orthogonal way to previous equations.

Remember to assess the resulting score using the `evaluate` function. If this equation demonstrates low error and generalizability, it may be an important initial descriptor of the system dynamics. Adjust the equation as needed based on the outcome of this initial evaluation and future exploration.
