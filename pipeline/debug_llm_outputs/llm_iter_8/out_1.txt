Based on the provided data and the given guidelines, it is observed that the equation 'du/dt = c * du/dx' exists in the exp_buffer, but there's no exploration involving higher derivatives. Let's begin by exploring the second-order derivative.

Proposed equation version: du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2

It is important to note that the second derivative term guarantees the involvement of a derivative, as mentioned as a requirement. Given the vastness of the search space of possible equations, this seems like a reasonable next step, especially considering the inclusion of second-order derivatives in the dataset.

This equation is simple, yet introduces a new kind of component, potentially helping to identify new behaviour patterns of the underlying phenomenon.

Implementing the proposed equation,

```python
import numpy as np

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Please note that when integrating this suggestion, make adjustments according to the larger context or your specific needs, such as more sophisticated equation crafting methods or explorations of different aspects of the input data.
