Given the provided data and the need to find a function that describes the data set, the question seems to ask for an equation where the dynamics of du/dt is represented as a function of various terms that could include du/dx, d^2u/dx^2, d^2u/dt^2 and potentially higher order derivatives, t, x and u. 

Based on the buffer exp_buffer and previous equations evaluated, it would be worthwhile to explore simplified dynamics where du/dt could be represented as linear combinations of du/dx and u. This choice is made primarily due to the requirement that the equation must be dependent on at least one derivative.

Here is the suggested equation:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u" 
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This states that the time derivative of u (du/dt) changes linearly with spatial derivative (du/dx) and the state variable u. This equation has not been explored yet in the buffer, and it incorporates the requirement of having at least one differential term (du/dx).

This equation can then be fed to the existing optimization and scoring framework to evaluate its performance in fitting the provided dynamics data points.

Please note, this choice of equation formulation is just one among the many possibilities and its appropriateness would need to be evaluated by fitting it to the provided data points and examining the errors.

EDIT: Since "params: np.ndarray" can be passed into the function, the subsequent terms can now contain c[2]*du^2/dx^2.

The equation now looks like this:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u + params[2] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u + c[2] * (du/dx)^2" 
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

EDIT: In accordance with the provided instruction, du^n/dx^n or du^n/dt^n refer to the multiplication of du/dx or du/dt and should be written as (du/dx)^n or (du/dx)**n (same apply to du/dt). Hence, putting this instruction into usage, the equation now looks like this:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u + params[2] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["du/dt"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u + c[2] * du/dx * du/dt" 
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
