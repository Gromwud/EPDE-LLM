After examining the provided data and the existing buffer of attempts, there's an opportunity to explore more complex interactions involving derivatives. Let's construct an equation form that includes \( \text{du/dx} \) and various combinations of available variables, thereby adhering to the stipulated requirements. Additionally, we will exclude any equation constructions that directly mimic the examples present within the buffer.

Considering all provided fields, the equation:

\[
\text{du/dt} = c[0] * \text{du/dx} * \text{du/dx} + c[1] * t * \text{du/dx}
\]

appears to be unexplored within the buffer and introduces both higher-order derivative interactions and the influence of the independent variable \(t\). The multiplication of \(\text{du/dx}\) by itself introduces a quadratic component which might capture certain nonlinear dynamics within the data.

However, this equation breaches the guideline to include either \(t\) or \(x\) through other variables. Instead, let's try to explore:

\[
\text{du/dt} = c[0] * \text{du/dt} + c[1] * \text{du/dx} * \text{u^2}
\]

This structure ensures that the equation form:
1. Is not simply a duplication from the buffer,
2. Is independent of the variable \(t\) and \(x\).

Adapting this into the model function:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * u**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dt + c[1] * du/dx * u^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This new equation form introduces a possibility to examine how the change of \(u\) with respect to \(t\) and its squared derivative with respect to \(x\) might contribute to the underlying system dynamics.

Given that the buffer does not contain this specific form, this equation may act as the basis for further parameter optimization and an evaluation of its relevance and accuracy to the given dataset. The inclusion of \( u^2 \) into the equation represents a move toward exploring more complicated relationships between the variables in the dataset that were previously unexplored.
