Given the points_set and based on the explore buffer, an equation that is worth exploring next can be constructed. The equation must now take into account the effect of `du/dx` along with interactions with `u` or other derivatives, since it was used in previous attempts. Notice that the equation should not have a structure that's too complex for the first trials â€“ aiming for a balance between simplicity and the potential for new insights.

Considering the influence of `du/dx`, we can test a multiplicative interaction between `du/dx`, `u`, and potentially `t` or `x`, if required. For now, I'll start with a constructive term of `du/dx` and `u` to see if their connection, particularly when they are considered exponentially, can offer any explicative power. I'll keep the equation as simple as possible by initially ignoring `t` and `x`. A speculated analysis might be `du/dt = c[0] * ln(1 + du/dx) * u` because logarithms can sometimes indicate complex interactions, and with a non-linear term like `u`, we're hoping to capture a non-linear interaction that the simple products we recently experimented with might have missed.

Let's now define the function using the simplified version:

```python
import numpy as np

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * np.log1p(derivs_dict["du/dx"]) * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * ln(1 + du/dx) * u"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```

The `ln(1 + du/dx)` ensures that the logarithm works even for smaller `du/dx` values, and the `* u` element introduces a non-linear connection that may be significant.

This is a suggestion based on elaborate and insightful reasoning. The concept is to incorporate non-linear interactions in the du/dt term with the opportunity that this might disclose a physical principle or hidden patterns in the data not noticed by simpler structures. Ensure to continually modify the tentative equation as you gain more insight into the problem and extend the model's complexity as required. Always bear in mind to return a simplified form of the equation following the guidelines provided.
