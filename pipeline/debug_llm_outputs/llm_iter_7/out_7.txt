The information provided includes a rich dataset with combined temporal, spatial, and solution data. Given the focus on exploring simpler to more complex structures of the equation, whilst avoiding the usage of structures already considered in `exp_buffer`, I propose an equation that relates `du/dt` to `du/dx` and the first partial derivative in space `du/dx` in a non-linear way. We assume that `t` and `x` indirectly affect `du/dt` through their influence on `u` and the derivatives.

A possible exploration could consider:

1. `du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)**2 + c[1] * x * (du/dx)**2`
    - This structure includes a non-linear relationship between `du/dx` and `du/dt`, and tests for a high sensitivity of `du/dt` to the change in `u` with respect to `x` (`du/dx`). The term `x * (du/dx)**2` explores if there is an additional effect of `x` on the relationship that is quadratic in `du/dx`.
    - We exclude direct linear terms like `du/dx`, as their behavior is a subset of this formulation and can be adequately captured through the parameter `c[0]`.
    - This equation is unique and not present in the exp_buffer.

To conform to all requirements:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, dummy: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2) + params[1] * t * (derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2)
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)**2 + c[1] * t * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Let's perform the evaluation on the proposed equation using the `evaluate` function in your current structured framework. This step will entail optimizing the function parameters and reviewing the fit's score.

```python
# Sample usage
inputs = np.atleast_2d([t, x, u]).T  # Assuming `t`, `x`, `u` are numpy arrays
derivs_dict = {  # Example of derivs_dict content
    "du/dt": ...,  # actual du/dt values
    "du/dx": ...,  # actual du/dx values
    ...  # more terms here
}

score = evaluate({"inputs": inputs, "derivs_dict": derivs_dict})
print(f"The evaluation score for the equation is: {score}")

``` 

The success of the equation heavily depends on the results of this score and if it improves upon or complements the current attempts in the exploration buffer. The evaluation score is a critical quantifier of the equation's viability. 

Let's perform these steps to validate the equation's effectiveness in representing the data in your set `points_set`. The results should shed light on the equation's potential efficacy in predicting `du/dt` based on `du/dx` in a non-linear context, alongside the indirect effect of `t`. This will inform us whether a further refinement is required, or if this equation holds promise.
