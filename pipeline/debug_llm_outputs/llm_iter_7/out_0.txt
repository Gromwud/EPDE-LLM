Based on the data provided, it appears there's a linear relationship between `du/dt` and `du/dx`. Therefore, the function `equation_v1` can be specified to reconstruct this relation. In this case, `du/dt` can be modeled as a linear function of `du/dx` with a constant `c[0]` representing this linear relationship.

Code for the `equation_v1` function can be written as follows with `du/dt` as the dependent variable and `du/dx` as the independent variable:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = {:.2f} * du/dx".format(params[0])
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This function implements the relation `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx`.

`params[0]` is the coefficient that will be fitted to data.

Please note that in order to properly test this function, it needs to be incorporated into the main script along with the input data you have provided. Additionally, you would need to set `P` in `np.array([1.0]*P)` to the same parameter length, which is `1` in this case for function `equation_v1`. Finally, call the functions in a way that is appropriate for your testing needs. For example, you might want to evaluate the constructed equation using the `evaluate` function with the provided input data. If everything is properly configured, it should return the evaluation score which defines how well the equation重现es the given data.

Keep in mind that this is a very simplified form of modeling the data using function `equation_v1`. Depending on the complexity of the relationships within input data, a more advanced model might need to be developed.
