```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # Let's explore a derivative-based structure where du/dt is proportional to the product of du/dx and d^2u/dx^2
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This function equation_v1 is a new attempt explicitly mentioned by the instruction. It is designed to explore the form 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2' which hasn't been tried in the exp_buffer dictionary, taking into consideration the advice in 'Note' that higher derivatives should be referenced in terms of derivatives (like 'd^2u/dx^2'), not as multiplications of derivatives. This equation is derivative-based, involving the product of the first and second spatial derivatives of u, and can potentially reveal complex spatial interactions within the given data points.
