Based on the given data and the previous attempts documented in the `exp_buffer`, it seems like exploring the interactions involving derivatives and their powers might reveal some underlying structure. Since simpler forms have already been explored, let's increase the complexity by considering quadratic terms of `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2`, without forgetting the role of `u` and its derivatives in depicting the system's dynamics.

A possible equation form that considers these aspects could be:
\[ du/dt = c[0] \cdot (du/dx)^2 + c[1] \cdot u \cdot (du/dx)^2 \]

This equation takes into account the effect of the slope of `u` with respect to `x` (`du/dx`), and considers how this effect is modified or enhanced by the value of `u` and the square of the slope. This interaction could capture non-linear variations in the rate of change of `u` with respect to time (`du/dt`) due to the relationship between `u` and its spatial derivative.

Here is the corresponding function:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
   right_side = params[0] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2) + params[1] * u * (derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2)
   string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * u * (du/dx)^2"
   len_of_params = 2
   return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation is not present in the `exp_buffer` dictionary, and it explores the prescribed equation space by considering quadratic terms of spatial derivatives and their non-linear interaction with `u`.
