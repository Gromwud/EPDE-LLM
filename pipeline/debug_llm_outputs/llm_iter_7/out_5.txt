Based on the given input data and the exploration buffer, it seems that the system has a high sensitivity to the first derivative of u with respect to x, i.e., du/dx, and the second derivative of u with respect to x, i.e., d^2u/dx^2, and t. Therefore, it is worth exploring equations that include these variables and their interactions. Additionally, previous attempts to find the equation suggest that du/dx is an essential component of the solution. 

An equation that could fit the data is the following: 

`du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * d^2u/dx^2` 

This equation includes du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, which are essential based on the previous attempts. And, t is included as well to explore the effect of time on the equation. It is kept relatively simple while exploring higher-order derivatives, without comprising potential interactions with other variables.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This equation is not present in the exploration buffer and meets all stated requirements. It is novel and explores potential interactions between the input variables as requested. This is a simple attempt, I suggest going more complex if needed. However, it's important to test how well the equation fits the given data before moving to more complex structures.
Please proceed with optimizing and evaluating the equation using the given evaluate function.
