Based on the provided data and the guidelines, let's construct a new equation to explore. Considering t and x do not stand out as dominant in controlling the rate of change of u, we can focus on how u and its derivatives interact. Let's assume there is an inexplicit interaction between the first and second derivative of u with respect to x to t.

We will explore an equation of the form:
\[du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2\]

The rationale is as follows:
- We assume that the change of u (du/dt) could be depending on how quickly the second derivative of u with respect to x changes when u changes (measured by du/dx). This is represented with the term `du/dx * d^2u/dx^2`.
- We also consider that there might be an independent effect from `d^2u/dx^2`, not directly tied to the rate of change of u.

Let's formulate this equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
