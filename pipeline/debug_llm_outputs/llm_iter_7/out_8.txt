Considering the provided data set and the exploration buffer, it is evident that simpler expressions with first and second derivatives have been explored with scores ranging from 807 down to 196. To follow the instruction to explore the interactions between the variables and to focus on expressions that haven't been investigated yet, one could venture into a combination of variables that perhaps hasn't been directly tested.

For this attempt, an exploration with a form that involves the higher order derivatives and interactions with first derivatives and the input variable \( t \) could be attempted while making sure that \( du/dx \) or some interaction involving it is included. So, the expression will take a form involving both first and second derivatives of \( u \) and multiplying them by variables \( t \), \( u \) and themselves. 

Here is the proposed function:

```python
def equation_v2(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # proposed equation
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict['du/dx'] * derivs_dict['d^2u/dt^2'] + params[1] * t * derivs_dict['du/dx'] * derivs_dict['d^2u/dx^2']
    string_form_of_the_equation = 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dt^2 + c[1] * t * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2'
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
``` 

This provides an example of using a combination of variables and higher order derivatives that haven't been included in the exploration buffer yet.
