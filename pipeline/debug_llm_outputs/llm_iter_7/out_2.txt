Let's first understand that as per the discussed requirements we need to stitch together a function description, and then based on the structure of the `points_set` data given, we want to form an equation of the type `du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2)`, exploring the space for equations that the `exp_buffer` has not yet tried.

From the sample data of `points_set`, it's clear that the value of `du/dt` has varying relationships with `t`, `x`, `u`, `du/dx`, `d^2u/dt^2`, and `d^2u/dx^2`; but often in these situations, it's the derivative terms that might influence `du/dt`. Given what we know, a simple structure of `F` might include a linear relation to the considered derivative terms, such as `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2`.

We have seen in `exp_buffer` that `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx` has been already tried and scored as 537, and `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dt` has also been tried, scoring as 275. Since we're aiming to suggest an equation that is not yet in `exp_buffer` and also looking for a further exploration, it might be interesting to combine `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2` terms in some manner that the functions suggested so far have not included, like their multiplication or division.

Given this, we want to form an equation of the type `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2`. To avoid duplicating any explored equation pattern in the `exp_buffer`, we'll work with the product of the first-order and second-order spatial derivatives.

As required by the task, we must provide the simplified equation expression, ensuring that it is not present in `exp_buffer`, then we would implement the corresponding function using the input variable names and the required derivative terms from `derivs_dict`.

Here's how such implementation might look:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Thus we made an input variable agnostic equation form suggestion using the derivative terms `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2`, seeking to explore the space of equations that includes an interaction between these terms, which has not been included in the previous attempts as stored in `exp_buffer`.
