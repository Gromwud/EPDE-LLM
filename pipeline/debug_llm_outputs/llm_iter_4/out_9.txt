In this case, considering the data and to explore an equation that is not in the exp_buffer, we may formulate an equation that includes higher order derivatives and non-linear combinations of the derivatives. For instance, "du/dt" may be dependent on a higher order derivative d^2u/dx^2 and it may have a non-linear interaction with du/dx. The following equation can be considered:

du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)**2 + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2

This equation has not been previously evaluated based on the entries in exp_buffer.

Note that, in terms of this equation, we compute du/dt as a function of the square of du/dx and the product of u with d^2u/dx^2.

Let's implement this equation in code.

```python
def equation_v1(t, x, u, derivs_dict, params):
    # Compute the right-hand side of the equation
    right_side = params[0] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 2) + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    # Create a string representation of the equation for visualization purpose
    string_form_of_the_equation = 'du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)**2 + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2'
    len_of_params = len(params)  # Number of parameters in the equation
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
Now we can evaluate the constructed equation. This might help us to gain new insights and potentially find a better fit for the dataset. This will also help us to explore the high order derivatives and non-linear interactions between dependent variables and derivatives.
