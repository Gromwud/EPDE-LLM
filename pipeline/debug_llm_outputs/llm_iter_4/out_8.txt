```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * derivs_dict["du/dt"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * du/dt"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```
This equation includes two derivatives, du/dx and d^2u/dx^2 * du/dt. These derivatives are linearly combined with parameters c[0] and c[1] respectively. This form of the equation was not previously in the exp_buffer, and since it involves two derivatives that have not been combined in this exact way before in the list given, it could potentially reveal an interaction between spatial and temporal second derivatives, making it a worthy exploration in the context of potentially implicit relationships among the variables. Addressing specifics of the 'exp_buffer' and never directly repeating suggestions from it is key here. As the function evaluation is related to a metric that we aim to optimize, the choice of the equation structure should always be evaluated within the proper context provided by 'points_set' and 'exp_buffer'.
