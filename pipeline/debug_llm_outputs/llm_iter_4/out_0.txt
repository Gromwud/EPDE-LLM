Based on the data, it appears that a linear relationship between du/dt and du/dx could be a reasonable approximation for the function. Therefore, I will propose the following model:

`equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray)`

Let's assume du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du/dt^2

Where c[0] and c[1] are the model parameters that will be optimized based on the dataset.

The equation_v1 function can be defined as:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    equation = f"du/dt = {params[0]} * du/dx + {params[1]} * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, equation, len_of_params
```

The function takes the arrays t, x, u as inputs, which are time, space and state variables respectively, a dictionary of derivatives derivs_dict, which contains the derivatives of the state variable and an array params of model parameters c[0] and c[1]. 

It returns the right side of the equation, a string representing the equation, and the number of model parameters. 

This form is a simplification of the general form F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2) and uses only the 'du/dx'  derivative and 'd^2u/dt^2'. 

Note: You'll need to optimize the parameters by minimizing the loss function. This process is not specified in the function.
