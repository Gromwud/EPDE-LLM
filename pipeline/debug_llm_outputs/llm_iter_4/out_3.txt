Based on the given points set and exploring the equation space, it seems necessary to explore equations involving more complex relationships between input variables. For instance, let's explore the presence of the multiplication between 'du/dx' and 'u' as part of the equation structure, and also incorporating 't' for possible time-dependent characteristics in the relationship.

Below is a possible solution that responds to your requirements:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * u + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] - params[2] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    # Simplifying and expanding the right side equation to make sure it fulfills your requirement #3
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * t * du/dx - c[2] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
It's important to note that the terms are reordered here for the sake of simplicity, while still maintaining the mathematical consistency of the operation. This equation is intended to explore potential "inexplicit interactions" between the input variables 'du/dx', 'u', 't', and the higher-order derivative 'd^2u/dx^2', as you've asked for.

Finally, all the terms included in this equation satisfy your established requirements. Moreover, it doesn't have the form of any expressions that were previously explored. The equation `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * t * du/dx - c[2] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2` makes use of both du/dx and d^2u/dx^2 which fulfills your requirement that the equation is dependent on at least one derivative.

This equation hasn't been seen before in your exp_buffer dictionary, which was the first condition to be verified in your prompt.
