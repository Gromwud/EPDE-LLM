Based on the provided data and the requirements, I propose the following equation to model the given system:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This equation includes the second derivative of u with respect to x and the square of the first derivative of u with respect to x, which have not been explored in the previous attempts stored in the exp_buffer. These terms could potentially capture the complex interactions between the spatial and temporal derivatives, and will also be dependent on x and t through u and its derivatives. The equation is also dependent on at least one derivative as required.
