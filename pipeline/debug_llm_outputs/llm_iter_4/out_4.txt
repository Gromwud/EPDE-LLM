Given the complexity, the extensive input data, and the conditionals outlined in the query, this problem can be approached in a number of ways. Solutions should be designed to yield an equation that currently does not exist in the `exp_buffer` dictionary, and they should be expressed as a function which can be evaluated for scoring.

Here's an equation that has not been evaluated yet, considering the exp_buffer:

`du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * u + c[3] * t`

```python
def equation_v1(t, x, u, derivs_dict, params):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * u + params[3] * t
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * u + c[3] * t"
    len_of_params = 4
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This function will return an equation based on the derivative of u respect to x squared (d^2u/dx^2), the first derivative of u respect to x (du/dx), the solution (u), and time (t), keeping in focus to fulfill the requirement of including at least one derivative in the term (in this case, two derivatives). The function adheres to the outlined guidelines by being simplified, not having any derivatives in the form of du^n/dx^n, and ensuring that the string representation of the function is returned. It also imports necessary modules and do not repeatedly suggest the equation already evaluated in `exp_buffer`. The structure chosen (scoring four different parameters) would allow detecting potential interactions and relationships between these variables. 

Given the format of the `points_set`, one would need to feed the inputs and `derivs_dict` into the `evaluate` function to get a score for this equation. This will indicate how well the constructed function fits the given data points.

The relevance of variables `t` and `x` should not be underestimated because often these affect the solution (u) and thus the becoming dependent on its derivatives. This equation incorporates all these factors and attempts to find a relation with the most possibilities. 

It's important to note that this function represents an initial attempt to discover a plausible relation in the given dataset. Further iterations might involve other derivatives or interactions, if the initial scores are not effective. It's crucial to verify the resulting function's performance on your specific data.
