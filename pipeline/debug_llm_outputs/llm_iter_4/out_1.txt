```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dt^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```

For a simpler alternative, consider:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

``` 

Both functions return the right side of the differential equation as a numpy array, the string form of the equation, and the length of the params array (which should match the number of constants used in the equation).
In this structure, one function is an example of a more complicated model, while the second function represents a simpler model.
The goal is to explore the space of function forms that can be fit to the data, starting from the simpler alternatives and gradually increasing complexity if needed.
The constants c[] represent the parameters of the equation, which are optimized using the minimize function from the scipy.optimize module.
Remember to check exp_buffer for exact equality of your string_form_of_the_equation before introducing a new equation to the environment to save computational resources.
Feel free to adjust or modify the function to fit your specific needs.
