```python
import numpy as np

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * (du/dx)^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

My reasoning behind this choice is that:

1. We have not tried any equation formulation that explicitly involves the second-order derivative with respect to x (d^2u/dx^2) yet. In the previous attempts, derivations with respect to x were limited only to their first order (du/dx).

2. Another observation is that we have not tried squaring the first-order derivative (du/dx) in our equations so far.

It's recommended that we first employ simpler equations and then progress to more complicated ones if needed. In absence of a clear variable influence structure, it's a good idea to let the 'learning process' guide us - by letting the solvers tune the new variables. Therefore, with the above considerations in mind, I suggest adding a term that directly includes the second-order derivative (d^2u/dx^2) and squaring another term which is the first derivative with respect to x (du/dx). This produces the equation "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * (du/dx)^2" that is new and has not appeared in our previous attempts. It also adds less terms to the equation, which might make it easier for solvers to handle.
