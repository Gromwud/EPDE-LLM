Based on the provided data set and the requirement to explore the space of possible equations that can explain the observed derivative value (du/dt), we will construct a function that can potentially incorporate the derivative du/dx, which can be interpreted as a change in u with respect to x, and t as an independent variable, since the behavior of the system might depend on time. Given the constraint that we should avoid duplicating suggestions found in the "exp_buffer" dictionary, this function will avoid the direct use of "du/dx" or "u" in its simplest form.

The equation proposed to examine the dataset follows a structure that acknowledges the potential influence of t and x on du/dt, even though it employs the derivatives. This structure also ensures the involvement of du/dx, as required.

## Derived equation for exploration:
### Equation Structure:
\[
\text{du/dt} = c[0] * \text{du/dx} * t + c[1] * t * \text{d^2u/dx^2}
\]

This structure aims to examine how t might interact with du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, considering that previous explorations have involved simple terms like "du/dx" and "u". By allowing t to interact with du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, we aim to uncover any potential inexplicit relationships that could not be detected by simpler models. The inclusion of these parameters follows a multiplicative interaction to examine the influence of time on derivatives, given the multifaceted nature of the data.

## Implementation:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * t + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * t + c[1] * t * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

## Analysis:
This newly suggested equation captures a potential synergistic impact of time (t) and spatial derivatives on the rate of change of u over time. By including t alongside du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, we expand the scope of expression's power to represent the underlying physical or mathematical model that might govern this data set. This structure aligns with the exploration goal while upholding the requirement to suggest a unique equation compared to what has been tried before.
