```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * du/dt * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This equation is not present in the exp_buffer dictionary, and it involves the interaction of multiple derivatives as required by the task. The equation also respects the rules provided in the task such as changing powers to multiplications and opening all brackets in the returned string.

Additionally, this equation includes terms from different timesteps (du/dt and du/dx) and space coordinates (d^2u/dx^2), encouraging it to leverage variation in both time and space if such patterns exist in the data.
