Based on the characteristics provided in the data and considering the instructions, we can suggest an equation which hasn't been evaluated yet, incorporating terms that were previously not explored and keeping the request to include at least one derivative. 

The previous experiments appear to have involved products of variables with derivatives of order 1 and 2, along with the independent variables 't' and 'x'. To continue exploring the equation space, let's create a new equation that includes the same variables, but with different interaction patterns not seen in the exp_buffer. Here we incorporate a term that is the cubic of the second derivative with respect to 'x' (d^2u/dx^2) raised to the power of 3.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]**3
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (d^2u/dx^2)^3"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Feel free to adjust the equation if you believe there are other patterns or interactions that should be incorporated. This example is just one way to approach the equation generation, and the parameters and structure can be modified to suit specific insights or hypotheses you might have about the underlying physics or characteristics of the data.
