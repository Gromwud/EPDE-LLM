Based on the given data and the requirements, the function equation_v1 can be constructed to take into account the variables and their derivatives. Since the equation must be dependent on at least one derivative, we can initially consider the first derivative in x (du/dx) as a part of the equation. To explore the equation space, we can extend it by including the terms related to time (t) and the second derivative in x (d^2u/dx^2), as they are allowed to be involved in the equation space but expressed through u or its derivatives.

Let's define the equation as an interaction between du/dx, t, and d^2u/dx^2. We'll include a linear term for du/dx, a product of t and its coefficient, and a term representing the interaction between du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, each with their own coefficients.

This takes into account two requirements immediately: it's dependent on a derivative, and it includes variables and derivatives in a manner yet unexplored as per the exp_buffer. We will also ensure not to copy the equations in the exp_buffer by structuring the equation with specifically desired properties.

Here's the equation with a simplified structure as:

du/dt = c[0]*du/dx + c[1]*t + c[2]*(du/dx)*d^2u/dx^2

Since we are trying to explore the space, the equation complexity is increased by including higher order derivatives and the interaction term between derivatives which none of the previous attempts has taken into account.

Keep in mind that the coefficients c[0], c[1], and c[2] need to be optimized to fit the data. Here is how the equation_v1 function may look like:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t + params[2] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t + c[2] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This construction opens the way for exploring possible inexplicit interactions which has not been experimented so far, taking into account the higher order derivatives and the terms related to t, which might be expressing through u or its derivatives.

Note that the string form has been simplified by opening the brackets and avoiding any complex expressions for clarity. The structure of the proposed equation also complies with the provided guidelines in terms of structure and representation, creating a form that is neither identical to any previous attempts stored in the exp_buffer, nor has copied equations from the exp_buffer.
