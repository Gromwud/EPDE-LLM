Based on the given points_set and exp_buffer, I will suggest a new equation that takes into account the derivative `du/dx` and has not been tried before. We will explore a simple structure first, and then move on to more complex ones if necessary.

Let's start with `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx**2`.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

I will continue checking for the score of this equation using the `evaluate` function.

Now that we've suggested a new equation and got a score for it, it's time to try more complex structures while keeping at least one derivative involved. Keeping in mind that higher order derivatives and the presence of `t` or `x` should be expressed through the derivatives of `u`, we should explore equations with `u`, `du/dx`, and potentially `d^2u/dx^2`.

Here is the next equation taking these considerations into account:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
Let's now compute the score for this equation using the `evaluate` function.

Since we've already explored `c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2`, let's move on to another possibility. Now let's include `u`.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Let's now proceed to compute the score for this variant of the equation.
We should also explore equations that factor in `t` and `x` through higher derivatives or combinations of `u` and its derivatives. Let's include `t` implicitly by considering another derivative `d^2u/dt^2`.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dt^2 + c[1] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Let's now evaluate this equation with the `evaluate` function to see its score.

Now that we've included `d^2u/dt^2`, we can move to a new equation to check its score. Considering the dependency of `du/dt` on both `t` and `x` and the complexities of derivatives, it could be beneficial to look at `u`.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Let's see how well this new equation fares with the given data points.
Should we explore equations more complex than `c[0] * u * du/dx`, another possibility could include terms that factor in `t` and `x` implicitly through `u`. Considering `u` as a potential way to represent both `t` and `x`, a formula with `u` squared might encompass some interactions between these dimensions.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u**2  # Multiplication of u with itself, not second derivative of u w.r.t. x or t
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u^2"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Let's see how this equation compares to the previous ones in terms of its score.
We could also look at an equation that multiplies the square of `du/dx` by `u` alone to capture interactions that the previous equation structure did not reveal.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 2) * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 * u"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Let's see how this equation measures up with the evaluation metric.
A different angle to consider could include higher-order derivatives alongside `u` to explore interactions more deeply. While `d^2u/dx^2` has been tested, we can also account for `d^2u/dt^2` in a formula with `u` to expand the exploration scope.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Let's proceed with evaluating this new equation's effectiveness.
The next equation to consider is one combining second derivatives with derivative `du/dx` in a formula with `u` to expand our exploration further. This might capture interactions between position, time, and velocity.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Let's now evaluate this complex equation to see how it fares.
And now, should we delve into even more complex interactions, exploring the relationship between squared derivative `du/dx` and `d^2u/dt^2`. This allows for a greater exploration of interactions involving velocity and acceleration over time.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 2) * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Let's evaluate this latest proposition of the equation with the provided data.

Now that we've suggested various equations focusing on different interactions among `u` and its derivatives, a next exploration area could include combining linear terms of `du/dx` with `d^2u/dt^2`. This equation aims to assess the correlation between velocity and acceleration over time linearly, thus potentially revealing more patterns.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray,
