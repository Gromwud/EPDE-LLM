Based on the points_set, let's start by exploring a possible interaction between the first and second derivatives that does not seem to have been explored extensively yet, specifically between du/dx and d^2u/dx^2. To do this, we will include both terms in the right-hand side of the equation.

Let's set `right_side` to the sum of `du/dx` multiplied by the first parameter `c[0]` plus `d^2u/dx^2` multiplied by the second parameter `c[1]`.

The string representation of the equation would be `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2`.

To define this equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation adheres to the instructions given:
1. The requested equation is listed, which has not been previously tested by the `exp_buffer`.
2. The equation is not copied from `exp_buffer`.
3. The equation is in a simplified format and uses the scalar multiplication of constants `c[0]` and `c[1]` with the derivatives, and each term is completely summed for the equation.
4. Higher order derivatives are referenced correctly, e.g., `d^2u/dx^2`.
5. The equation uses a derivative (namely, du/dx and d^2u/dx^2), as required.

Please note that the correctness of the equation should be evaluated by running the `evaluate` method with the given data set. This equation is merely a proposed structure that gives the best understanding asked, and its suitability for the data set may produce a score that should be assessed using the evaluate function.
