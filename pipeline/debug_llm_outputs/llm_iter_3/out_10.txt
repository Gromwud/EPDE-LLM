Based on the input data and the exploration buffer, it appears there is a potential for interaction between the variables t, x, u, and their derivatives in describing the phenomenon that generates the data set.

The exploration buffer indicates the equations involving the first derivative (du/dx) and the second derivative with respect to x (d^2u/dx^2) have already been explored. Therefore, it might be beneficial to look into equations involving the second derivative with respect to t (d^2u/dt^2).

The consideration of du/dt being a function of higher order derivatives suggests a possible harmonic or oscillatory element in the system being modelled. Additionally, exploring the interaction between t, x, u, and their derivatives in a third order system might reveal new patterns.

The following equation is the selected candidate to further investigate these factors:
\[
du / dt = \beta_0*(d^2u/dx^2) + \beta_1*(du/dx)^2 + \beta_2*(d^2u/dt^2)*u
\]

Therefore the equation in form of a function where the x's are the inputs values, y are the outputs (du/dt) and \beta is a vector of the parameters of the equation to be determined:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2 + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"] *  u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * du/dx^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dt^2 * u"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```

In this equation:
"c[0] * d^2u/dx^2"  might account for the spatial variation of the system;
"c[1] * du/dx^2" might be related to the non-linearity of the dynamics in terms of the change in u with respect to x;
"c[2] * d^2u/dt^2 * u" might reflect the temporal acceleration dynamics in terms of u and the derivative with respect to t.

This equation is hypothesized based on the exploration buffer and the need for exploring interactions between variables, higher order derivatives, and the existence of a possible harmonic or oscillatory component in the system. It does not duplicate any previous attempts and is also simplified to meet the requirements.
