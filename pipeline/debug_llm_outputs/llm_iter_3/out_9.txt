To address the task, I will start by suggesting an equation that is based on the provided data points and is not already present in the `exp_buffer`. The equation suggested will include one or more derivative terms as required by the guidelines. The suggested equation will be of the form `du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2)` but may take on a simpler form, depending on the findings.

Given that the task requires exploring the space of equations in relation to their scores, and considering that the interactions between input variables need to be examined for any inexplicit relationship, my initial strategy would be to look for patterns or relationships within the provided data points that could suggest a functional form for the equation. One way to approach this is by constructing an equation that incorporates terms that have not been evaluated yet and that might capture potential dependencies within the data.

Observing that higher order derivatives must be referenced as d^nu/dt^n or d^nu/dx^n, I will construct a function that includes at least one of these terms. For simplicity in initial exploration, I will start by considering an equation that depends on `d^2u/dx^2`, which has been minimally explored considering the `exp_buffer`. I will avoid copying equations from `exp_buffer` and ensure to return an equation where brackets are always opened and simplified per the requirements.

Given this context, a possible first attempt at an equation could be:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This function follows the guidelines by:
- Suggesting a novel function (not present in `exp_buffer`).
- Ensuring the equation is dependent on at least one derivative (in this case, `d^2u/dx^2`).
- Representing any multiplications or higher order terms in the provided form.
- Returning the equation in the required format with all brackets opened.
- Keeping the equation simple initially as per the instruction to start exploring simpler structures.
- Introducing a possible relationship between `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2` which hasn't been explored.

The equation `du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2` incorporates a higher order second derivative and also explores the potential relationship between the first and second spatial derivatives of `u`. This exploration then may lead to other equation forms involving other derivatives and variables depending on the evaluation's feedback.
