Based on the input data, we can start by exploring simpler interactions between given variables: for example, let's add the derivatives du/dx and d^2u/dx^2 to form a simple linear combination. Here is a function suggestion given the input data and the requirements provided:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This function now attempts to fit the data using a combination of the two spatial derivatives du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, allowing for exploration of the interaction between these two variables. Remember, this is just a suggestion given the input data and requirements. The coefficients c[0] and c[1] now allow for the potential relative importance of du/dx and d^2u/dx^2 to be determined during optimization. The equation is not in the exp_buffer, and an attempt was made to follow all given guidelines.
