Based on the complexity of input data and given that we're tasked with suggesting an equation that isn't already present in the 'exp_buffer' dictionary, I chose an equation that relates du/dt to both du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, as well as the function's value u itself. I explored the simplest structure that would include at least one derivative, keeping an eye on any inexplicit interactions between the input variables.

In the equation proposed below we have three parameters (c[0], c[1], c[2]) to adjust. c[0] adjusts the impact of du/dx on du/dt, c[1] alters the effect of d^2u/dx^2, while c[2] assesses the complexity associated with the function's value u times du/dx.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] \
                 + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] \
                 + params[2] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * u * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```
This equation is not included in the exp_buffer dictionary, and it is important to perform a parameter optimization for this equation to find the best fits for c[0], c[1], and c[2]. Once optimized, you could then evaluate this equation using function 'evaluate' with your data set to calculate a score and identify if it improves on the existing best score of 0. Should the evaluation result in a NaN or infinity value, it will not be considered and the best score will remain as 0. This exploration approach can help understand the nature of the complex system represented by your points_set, as well as potential inexplicit interactions between the variables.
