Based on the given input data and the exp_buffer, I am going to suggest an equation that is not already present in the exp_buffer. I am targeting the simplest form of interaction between variables at first and then can gradually move towards more complex structures if justified by the data.

Let's explore a linear dependency on du/dt with each of the given features as the equation needs to depend on at least one derivative. Considering that the relationship with t or x might be expressed via u or its derivatives, we should check if there are any direct dependencies on du/dx, u * du/dx, d^2u/dx^2, or similar forms.

A simple equation that hasn't been tested yet can be:

`du/dt = c[0] * (u * du/dt) + c[1] * (du/dx * d^2u/dx^2)`

Although according to the exp_buffer, the term `du/dt * u * du/dx` and `u * (du/dx)^2` didn't yield the lowest scores, it could be that combining du/dx with d^2u/dx^2 introduces an interaction that affects the du/dt dependency in a manner unexplored thus far.

Here's the equation function following those guidelines:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # Defining the linear combination of the derivatives and their interactions
    right_side = params[0] * (u * derivs_dict["du/dt"]) + params[1] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"])
    # Formatting the string representation of the equation
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dt + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    # Length of the parameters list
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
