Based on the input data and the exploration buffer, it seems worth exploring an equation that involves the interaction of some of the derivatives with the variable $t$.
Let's try the following equation:
$$\frac{du}{dt} = c[0] * \frac{du}{dx} + c[1] * \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c[2] * t * \frac{d^2u}{dx^2}$$

Here's the corresponding Python function:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * t * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * t * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation hasn't been explored yet based on the exploration buffer and includes the essential derivative $\frac{du}{dx}$. It also considers higher-order derivatives $\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}$ and involves the variable $t$ in an interaction with this higher-order derivative. This choice attempts to capture the dynamic evolution of $u$ with space and time by examining the rate of change of $u$ with respect to space (first derivative) and its acceleration (second derivative), alongside the influence of time.
