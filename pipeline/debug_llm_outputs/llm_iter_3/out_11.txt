Based on the data and the complexity required, we could try a function that uses all the available derivatives and the dependent variable u. We will give it some non-linear interaction between variables. Here's the suggested function and corresponding equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict['du/dx']**2 + params[1] * derivs_dict['d^2u/dx^2'] + params[2] * u * derivs_dict['du/dx'] + params[3] * derivs_dict['d^2u/dt^2']
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx**2 + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * u * du/dx + c[3] * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 4
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

In the above function:

- c[0] * du/dx**2 : Adds non-linearity to the derivative respect to x.
- c[1] * d^2u/dx^2: Considers the second derivative with respect to x.
- c[2] * u * du/dx : Adds non-linearity to the dependent variable and du/dx.
- c[3] * d^2u/dt^2 : Considers the second derivative with respect to time.

Note that the function is dependent on at least one derivative (du/dx and d^2u/dx^2) as instructed. This setup allows exploring the space of possible equations that are not present in the 'exp_buffer' and offers a rich interplay between multiple derivatives and the dependent variable u. This suggestion can potentially discover some unknown interactions between the variables and their derivatives. Also, the form of the equation respects the requirements from the task. The equation was not copied or identical to any equations in the 'exp_buffer'. This equation is also not a member of exp_buffer, as said: it is not included in the dictionary in any form. Therefore, we explore a new area of the possible equations space.
