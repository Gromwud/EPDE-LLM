Based on the data provided and considering the general form of the equation and the restrictions provided, we can explore interactions between variables, starting with simpler structures. Given the limitations on mentioning t or x directly yet considering their possible influence through u and its derivatives, an equation that might fit while looking for inexplicit interactions could be:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * u * du/dx"

    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation includes both a linear term in du/dx, which is common in diffusion-dominated equations, a second derivative term d^2u/dx^2 which could represent diffusion or curvature effects, and a nonlinear term that is a product of u and du/dx which might give rise to advection or non-linear diffusion effects, accounting for potential interactions between the concentration or state variable and its gradient. The structure aligns with the guidelines and differs significantly from those already present in the `exp_buffer`. 

The chosen form suggests that the rate of change (du/dt) in the variable we're interested in may depend on both its first spatial derivative (du/dx) and second spatial derivative (d^2u/dx^2), as well as its value (u) multiplied by its gradient (du/dx). This equation reveals possibly nontrivial feedbacks or couplings in the system which could be nonlinear in nature, without explicitly invoking t or x but still accounting for any possible dependence on these through u.
