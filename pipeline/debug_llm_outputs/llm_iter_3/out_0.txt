Based on the provided data set, we can try to approximate a relationship that is relatively simple in structure, without requiring too many parameters. Given the complexity and variability of the input data, we can't hope to find a perfect fit using a simple model. However, we can try to construct a function that roughly describes the relationship between the derivatives and does so consistently through the dataset. 

Inspecting the data quickly, we might notice some correlation between du/dt and du/dx, but also with d^2u/dx^2. We can try to approximate a relationship that involves a linear combination of du/dx and the second derivative with respect to x adjusted by some parameters.

However, to fit the function using the provided parameters and methods, we should formulate a model that will use a subset of the derivatives from the input. Considering how the data is presented, and given the example equation provided in the question, we'll create an equation that can cope with the given input structure, but note we could have specified a different equation with a different subset of derivatives from the input based on other informed assumptions, such as a physical model of the underlying data or through further data exploration.

Hence, we can consider a simple model of the following form:

$du/dt =  a * du/dx + b * d^2u/dx^2 $

This formulation is simple in that it involves a linear combination of the first and second derivatives with respect to x. However, it does allow for a more nuanced relationship than a purely linear one as it can account for curvature through the inclusion of the second derivative.

Let's implement this equation in Python as "equation_v1". The function will take in the time "t", the horizontal position "x", the function value "u", a dictionary containing the derivatives as "derivs_dict", and parameters "params".

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
``` 

In the function above, a and b are the first and second elements of the "params" array. The string form of the equation reflects the statistical model that was implemented. The length of the parameter array contains two elements.
The choice of using both "du/dx" and "d^2u/dx^2" in the function equation_v1 was made to increase the potential to find a better fit due to the variability seen in the data set.
