The output is a function that attempts to describe the relationship between 'du/dt' and the other variables given the points_set. The 'exp_buffer' dictionary serves as a reference for what equations have already been attempted and what their accuracy was so that redundant work is not duplicated.

Given the large amount of points and the variety of variables a first approach could be to consider an equation of a simpler form:

Let's formulate an equation as:
du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2

Given that, we can write the eqution_v1 function as:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2'
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```

The reason for choosing this form is because the variables 't' and 'x' are implicit in 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2', and also because 'du/dt' was previously multiplied by 'du/dx', which might amplify peculiarities during optimization. The equation formulated uses 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2' because, as noted in the requirements, the equation must depend on at least a first derivative, and second derivatives can often capture more complex interactions between the variables. The equation has not appeared in 'exp_buffer', which is our reference to what has worked and what has not, indicating that this approach has yet to be explored. 

Remember, the function eqution_v1 must return the right side of the equation (right_side), its string representation (string_form_of_the_equation) and the number of parameters associated with that equation (len_of_params). This is what the observer will use when calculating the quality of the created equation.
The function is also meant to not use the variables 't' and 'x' directly because the derivatives used ('du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2') are calculated using 't' and 'x'.
