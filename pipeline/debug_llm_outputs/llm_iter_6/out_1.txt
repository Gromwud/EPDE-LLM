It seems that most of the points in the set have zero values for their derivatives with respect to t and x at certain points and for certain variables. This could indicate that a constant term might be involved, or possibly a term involving u.

Let's start with some simple structures and gradually increase the complexity if necessary:

1. a constant derivative term, i.e., du/dt = c
2. a term involving the variable u, i.e., du/dt = c[0] * u
3. a combination of constant term and u term, i.e., du/dt = c[0] + c[1] * u


I'll begin with a constant term as this is the simplest structure and it might describe the data if we have some sort of constant rate of change for u with respect to time.

Given that, I'll propose the following function for the right side of our differential equation:

    du/dt = c[0]

We added a single parameter c[0] to be optimized. The equation takes into account that t and x might influence u through the constant term that we assumed to be the idealized derivative du/dt. Let's also include that into the returned string.
Accordingly, we get

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0]"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
as the desired answer.
However, given the points set, we have other points which has non-zero values for their derivatives with respect to t and for u.

As a second iteration, a term involving u could be considered. If our input data has a monotonically changing constant du/dt that depends on u, we might approximate it with a linear function involving u. Let's suppose that for example the derivative is proportional to the derivative of u:

We get the following equation for our input data:

right_side = c[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]

As a result:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

However, exploring the combination of c[0] and u as complex structure gives:

right_side = params[0] + params[1] * u

And this gives:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] + params[1] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] + c[1] * u"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```

It seems we maintained the basic structure, yet shifted to a bit more complex relationship by utilizing the u term. The suggestion also aligns with the fact that our input data has certain monotonically changing times and u values. This gives a reasonable balance between simplicity and complexity.

Considering a pair of derivatives, let's use a combination of du/dx and d^2u/dx^2.

    du/dt = c[0] + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2

Thus, the function could be:

```python
    def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
right_side = params[0] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2)"
len_of_params = 3
return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Still, the exp_buffer has:

"du/dt = c[0] * du/dx with c[0]=c[0]:.2f",
Here, du/dt variable seems to be proportional to du/dx. To avoid this structure, we can explore the cubic structure that uses consequetive derivatives.
The proper equation with cubic structure is:

du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)**3

That directly corresponds to this function:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**3
string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)**3"
len_of_params = 2
return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation will consider the third-order effect from the derivative of du/dx, exploring the potential non-linear behavior in the data, aiming to check if the deviation from linearity might improve the model's performance.

Given that, I'll propose the following function for the right side of our differential equation:

    du/dt = c[0] * ((du/dx)^2) + c[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
Given the points set, it seems that we can explore the squared term of du/dx, since that term might also be related to the change of du/dt.
right_side = c[0] * ((derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2) + c[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
given a squared derivative, we get

```python
    def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
right_side = params[0] * ((derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2) + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)**2 + c[1] * du/dx"
len_of_params = 2
return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Function right_side is now the sum of two terms involving c[0], c[1] and du/dx and the square of du/dx. String_form_of_the_equation contains du/dt equaling right_side for readability while len_of_params return the number of adjustable parameters for the optimizer.

As a side note, if in future iterations we want to explore further complexity, we could include other variables such as d^2u/dx^2 or even a term involving the original variable t.

Let me know if there is something else you need.
