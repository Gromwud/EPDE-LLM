Explanation: Considering the constraints and requirements, a possible function with the general equation form could be simple as suggested. It mostly depends on 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2' which are the derivatives of u with respect to x. These variables demonstrate inexplicit interactions between the data points since the rate of change of 'u' with respect to 'x' and how this rate changes as 'x' changes, have significant effects on the 'du/dt'. This suggestion takes into account that t and x are involved in the equation through 'u' and its derivatives. Exp_buffer does not include this combination of terms but includes similar variants which have not been cloned but refer to for ideas on what yet needs exploration. The string form, which is 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2', is returned in compliance with the requirement to return the simplified form. Higher order derivatives such as 'd^2u/dx^2' is included as required by the configuration. Consider also that if the points do not show any noticeable pattern or relationship in relation to 't', 'x', 'u' or 'du/dx', then the equation may very well be a simpler form as this. But in case the points show related, complex and inexplicit interrelations, a more complicated equation form should be returned, in simple cases, start by exploring simpler structures.
