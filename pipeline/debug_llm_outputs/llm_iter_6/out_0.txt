From the given points set, we can observe a linear relationship between the derivative of u with respect to time (du/dt) and the derivative of u with respect to x (du/dx). This observation is based on a quick inspection of the data distribution of these quantities (the correlation coefficient between du/dt and du/dx can also be calculated to confirm a strong linear relationship). This behavior suggests a simple advection equation or a simplified wave equation. Here is a tentative function definition that embodies this relation with a tunable parameter c.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = c[0] * du/dx with c[0]={params[0]:.2f}"    
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

In this snippet, the proposed dynamic equation is du/dt = c * du/dx with c being a system parameter that should be optimized against the data. The adapted model is then simply the product of the spatial gradient of u (i.e., du/dx) by the parameter c that multiplies this gradient to express the time variation of u. The string prints the equation form and value of the parameter c.

This model is simple but it could suitably represent the data, given the observed linear dependency between du/dt and du/dx. Keep in mind that a more complex equation could match the data better but this simple choice already seems to embrace a large part of the variability in du/dt.
