Based on the available data and the examples given, I would suggest exploring a form of the equation that involves the derivative du/dx, as well as possibly a higher order derivative such as d^2u/dx^2. However, I would also consider the possibility that the equation might involve other combinations of derivatives and/or variables.

Given the examples provided, I might consider an equation of the form:
du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx

However, to avoid duplication, also taking into account the provided exp_buffer where the equation "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * du/dt * du/dx" has been previously evaluated, I've decided to suggest a different equation:

du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * d^2u/dt^2

Here's the python implementation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
Please take into account that it might be necessary to explore different equations to find the one with the best score, and consider further terms if the current one does not provide significant insight into the data. The derivatives were chosen as they reflect the dependencies described in the prompt. Please feel free to adjust this equation based on your understanding of the underlying physics or the behavior of the data if this is not the best fit.
