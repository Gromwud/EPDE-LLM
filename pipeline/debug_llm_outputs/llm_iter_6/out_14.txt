Based on the data provided and considering the exploration guidelines, a possible equation could involve interactions between t, du/dx and d^2u/dx^2. We can propose a function like du/dt = c[0]*t + c[1]*t*(du/dx)**2 + c[2]*d^2u/dx^2, ensuring this pattern is not in the exp_buffer. An example would be:

```python
import numpy as np

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0]*t + params[1]*t*(derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2) + params[2]*derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0]*t + c[1]*t*(du/dx)^2 + c[2]*d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Please establish that this equation isn't already in the exp_buffer and then test it with the evaluate function. To check if the equation patterns match, consider that the order of parameters and operations used can be interchangeable. For instance, 'c[0]*t * du/dx^2' can be equivalent to 't * c[0] * du/dx^2'. The equation can have variable orders and lengths but what matters is how parameters interact with the given variables. This proposed equation isn't identical to any equation pattern present in the exp_buffer.
