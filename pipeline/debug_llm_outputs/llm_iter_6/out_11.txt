This equation has not been explored in the exp_buffer and includes the involvement of 'du/dx', 'du/dt', and 'u' (as the function is set to be dependent on at least one derivative). The string representation is open-bracketed, and all higher order derivatives are referenced in the 'd^nu/dx^n' format. This equation is more complex, but does not copy any explored structures. Additionally no similar equations have been found in previous attempts, as described in exp_buffer. Please, test out this function and let me know if any other form you'd like me to explore.

Please provide feedback on this equation. You might also consider suggesting previously unexplored equations or specify equation forms that weren't considered. If no further exploration is required, it is also okay to let me know. I'm here to help you.
