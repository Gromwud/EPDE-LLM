Based on the provided data and the instruction to explore simpler structures and then gradually move on to more complicated ones if necessary, I would suggest a potential equation focusing on a second order derivative involving x.

Let's try `du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * t * (du/dx)**2`. Essentially we are incorporating potential non-linear interaction between the gradient (du/dx) squared and time (t) that scales with t. By doing so, we account for the possible influence of t over motion, coupled with the acceleration-like term (d^2u/dx^2), as this might indicate a response varying in space with rates of change in time (t) and space (x).

Here is the implementation of this equation:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * t * (derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2)
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * t * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This equation is not present in the exp_buffer, adheres to the requirement of being dependent on at least one derivative, and follows the criteria listed in the instructions. 

Notice the simulation of an influence of time on space variation of u's velocity, where such influence is via a interaction with the square of the spatial gradient (du/dx)^2.
