Based on the provided data, a possible function that could be described by the set of points 'points_set' is the following:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
In this function, c[0] and c[1] will be optimized by the BFGS method to minimize the error between the predicted and actual 'du/dt'. Note that in the buffer, there is only one example of an equation (du/dt = c[0] * du/dx), so I've chosen to make a slightly different equation by including the second derivative of u with respect to x, 'd^2u/dx^2'.

This equation is a general form of du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dx^2) because it includes 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2'. However, this equation can be simplified as it does not depend on t, x, u or d^2u/dt^2 directly. The constant terms (c[0] and c[1]) can potentially compensate for the dependence on 't' and 'x'. If after optimization we find that c[1] is nearly zero, then the equation [du/dt = c[0] * du/dx] will be a more accurate and reasonable approximation.

Remember that the loss function is optimized for the parameters c[0] and c[1], and the evaluation score is calculated from the difference between 'du/dt' and its predicted value. By considering 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2', we explore potential relationships within these variables which might have a noticeable impact on the accuracy of the predicted values.
