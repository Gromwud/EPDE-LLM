Based on the given data and exp_buffer, an equation that is not yet explored and might uncover an interaction between variables could be:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dt * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

The reason for choosing this equation is that it involves the first and second derivative with respect to x, and also creates a product between the dependent variable time derivative and the spatial derivative, an interaction that might not have been explored before and can uncover a hidden relationship based on the non-linear relationship between u and t. Additionally, the second order spatial derivative is also included as a linear term, contributing to the complexity and expressiveness of the equation model.
