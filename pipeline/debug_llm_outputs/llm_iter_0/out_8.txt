Based on the provided data, the function `du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2)` could possibly be described as `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * d^2u/dt^2 * t`. This equation is not found in the `exp_buffer` dataset. Now, let's write the function and check the score of this equation.
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"] * t
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * d^2u/dt^2 * t"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
Now, to find the best parameters of the equation (optimize the constants `c[0]` and `c[1]`), one can use the provided `evaluate` function on this `equation_v1` function by passing the `points_set` as the input data. If the optimized equation's score is closer to zero, it is a good fit for the data.
