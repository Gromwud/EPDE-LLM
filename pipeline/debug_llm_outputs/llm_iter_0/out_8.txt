Let's explore a new equation that is not in the `exp_buffer` and is structurally different from the ones already evaluated. Given the data and the requirement to include at least one derivative term, we can try a combination of first and second derivatives with respect to \(x\) and \(t\), and include a term involving \(u\).

Here is a new equation to explore:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * u * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation includes:
- The first derivative with respect to \(x\) (du/dx)
- The second derivative with respect to \(x\) (d^2u/dx^2)
- A term involving \(u\) and the first derivative with respect to \(x\) (u * du/dx)

This combination introduces a potential interaction between the first derivative and the solution \(u\), which might capture more complex dynamics in the data. The equation is structurally different from the ones already in the `exp_buffer` and should be evaluated to see if it provides a better fit.
