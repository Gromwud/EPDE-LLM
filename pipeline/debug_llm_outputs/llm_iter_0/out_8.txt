Based on the input data and the exp_buffer, an equation that hasn't been explored yet could be:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 2)
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation introduces a new term - the square of the derivative du/dx - which hasn't been used in previous attempts. The term (du/dx)^2 is added to the du/dx term, with each term being modulated by its own constant coefficient c[0] and c[1], respectively. The inclusion of the square term (du/dx)^2 introduces a nonlinear relationship between du/dt and du/dx, which could potentially better explain the variations in the data.
