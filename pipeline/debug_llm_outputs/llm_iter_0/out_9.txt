Analyzing the provided data and taking into account the existing exploration buffer, I'm exploring a potential interaction between the differentials that has yet to be tested. I will now attempt to construct an equation that includes a multiplicative interaction between the first-order spatial derivative of u with respect to x and its time derivative, scaled by the variable u (which is also dependent on t and x).

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["du/dt"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx * du/dt"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation introduces a multiplicative term, representing the interaction between u, its spatial derivative, and its time derivative. This relationship has not been considered before based on the exp_buffer dictionary, offering us a new direction for potential patterns in the data.
