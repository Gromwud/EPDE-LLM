Given the extensive dataset provided, it appears that `d^2u/dx^2` and `du/dx` could have significant roles in the formation of `du/dt`. The prior attempts in the `exp_buffer` have taken into account various combinations of `du/dx`, `(du/dx)^2`, `u`, `d^2u/dx^2`, and `d^2u/dt^2`. Keep in mind that we need to avoid repetitions and work on possibly finding any inexplicit interactions that were not yet attempted.

A suggestion for a new formulation that accounts for a potential interaction between `u` and `d^2u/dx^2`, along with `du/dx` (which is a requirement), is:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # Derivatives from the dict
    du_dx = derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    d2u_dx2 = derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    # Construct right side of your equation
    right_side = (params[0] * du_dx**2) + (params[1] * u * d2u_dx2)
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)**2 + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation structure includes expressions that were not previously investigated as per the `exp_buffer`. While `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2` have been included in previous equations, their interaction with `u` in the specific form of `(du/dx)**2` and `u * d^2u/dx^2` represents an exploration of potential nonlinearities and dependencies that have not yet been explored.

It is worth noting that, since the general form allows `du/dt` to be expressed in terms of `t`, `x`, `u`, `du/dx`, `d^2u/dt^2`, and `d^2u/dx^2`, we should endeavor to include `du/dx` as a requirement in our equation, as seen in the given solution. Moreover, our exploration should gradually transition to more complex structures if no satisfying result is achieved from the simpler ones, all while attending to the criteria defined for equation simplification and the absence of repetition from existing trials.
