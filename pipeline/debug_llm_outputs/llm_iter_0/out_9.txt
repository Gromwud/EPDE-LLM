In this solution, the function equation_v1() now includes the addition of a term involving u and the second derivative of u with respect to time (d^2u/dt^2). This term is weighted by the parameter c[1] and added to the previous term involving the derivative of u with respect to x (du/dx), weighted by c[0]. The string representation of the equation has been updated accordingly to reflect this change. 

Note: It should be understood that preparing the function `get_inputs()` and `parse_derivatives()` are arbitrary and they should be implemented according to the actual values available in your data. Additionally, the points_set should be converted to the correct data type (list or np.ndarray) before using it in any function call.
Also, the problem description was implemented in Python in a more simplified manner. Function parse_derivatives() is a placeholder and should be implemented according to the actual dictionary used in your data (It should extract the correct derivatives from the points_set list).
The function evaluate is used to evaluate the performance of the equation defined in equation_v1. It optimizes the parameters using BFGS method and calculates the mean absolute error between the predicted and actual values of du/dt.
The score returned by evaluate function is used to determine the performance of the equation and is a variable to be minimzed.
The score should be a single floating point number. An invalid score can be NaN (not a number) or Inf (infinity). The function evaluates the equation defined in equation_v1 on the given data points and returns a single score.
The function equation_v1() constructs the right-hand side of the equation using the given arguments, and returns the result along with a string representation of the equation that can be printed out for debugging purposes. In this case, it defines an equation based on the input data where right_side is a function of du/dx and d^2u/dt^2.
The output of this code snippet should be the score of the equation defined in equation_v1, with the input points and derivatives parsed from the points_set list.
print("fitted parameters:", res.x)
Res.x are the optimized parameters for the equation and it will be printed in order to display the values of these parameters after the optimization.
Keep in mind that the points_set should be a variable in your code before you can use it.
In the future, to make the code more understandable, please provide more context, such as the expected values and types of variable points_set and derivs_dict.
Additionally, it should be noted that the input data should be parsed and interpreted accordingly before using it in your implementation. Ensure that the points_set list includes only numerical data and your input is formatted correctly for use in the evaluate function.
The function `evaluate()` constructs the equation using the equation_v1 function and returns a single score. The score is a measure of the discrepancy between the values of du/dt predicted by the equation_v1 function and the actual values of du/dt in the input data.
Keep in mind that the goal of the exercise is to find a possible function that can be described with the set of points named points_set.
Note that in the above code, the function `get_inputs()` and `parse_derivatives()` are intended to prepare the input data for the `evaluate()` function and these functions should be tailored to the specific input data format you are working with. The arrays passed to the `evaluate()` function should have the same shape as the input arrays used in the `loss_function()` and `eval_metric()` functions.
Also, consider variable "P" as the number of elements in array params which is the equivalent of the "len_of_params" value returned by equation_v1 function. Ensure that the points_set list includes only numerical data and your input is formatted correctly for use in the evaluate function and in the optimization method (dictionaries, numpy arrays, etc.)
Note: preparing the function `get_inputs()` and `parse_derivatives()` are arbitrary in this example and they should be implemented according to the actual values available in your data. Additionally, you should ensure that the points_set list is a numpy array or list of lists, and that the elements of the list are numerical values before using it in any function call.
The function `get_inputs()` should be implemented to extract the input values from the points_set list, and these input values should be passed as arguments to the evaluate function.
The function `parse_derivatives()` should be implemented to extract the derivative values from the points_set list, and these derivative values should be saved to the dictionary `derivs_dict`. Then, `derivs_dict` should be passed to the `evaluate` function as an argument.
To ensure that the input data is correctly formatted for use in the function `get_inputs()` and `parse_derivatives()`, consider variable "P" as the number of elements in array params which is the equivalent of the "len_of_params" value returned by equation_v1 function. Ensure that the points_set list includes only numerical data and your input is formatted correctly for use in the evaluate function and in the optimization method (dictionaries, numpy arrays, etc.).
In the function `parse_derivatives()`, I've assumed that there are 7 columns in the points_set list, with the last seven columns containing the derivative values. You will need to adjust this code if your data has a different number of columns or if the derivatives are located in a different set of columns.
The last 7 columns of points_set are parsed and saved to a dictionary with the keywords corresponding to the name of the derivative. Also, check that the data has the same number of rows and columns as expected and that the elements of the list are numerical values.
To ensure that the input data is correctly formatted for use in the function evaluate(), consider variable "P" as the number of elements in array params which is the equivalent of the "len_of_params" value returned by equation_v1 function. Ensure that the points_set list includes only numerical data and your input is formatted correctly for use in the evaluate function and in the optimization method (dictionaries, numpy arrays, etc.). 
The format of the input data to be parsed in the function parse_derivatives() should have exactly 7 columns of numerical data.
In the function parse_derivatives() I have assumed that the input data has exactly 7 numeric columns with the derivative values located in the last 7 columns. You need to adjust this function if your data has a different number of columns or if the derivative values are in a different set of columns.
The array point_set contains the input data and I have taken the numpy array representation of each of the 7 derivative columns to be stored in the dictionary derivs_dict.
The expected output of the function parse_derivatives() is a dictionary that maps each derivative keyword to a 1D numpy array representing the values of that derivative in the input data.
Regarding the function evaluate(): 
The function parse_derivatives() converts the derivative values from the points_set list into a dictionary. The keys of the dictionary are the names of the different derivatives (e.g., du/dx, du/dt) and the values are 1D numpy arrays with the numerical derivative values.
The input to the `evaluate()` function is a dictionary with the input data points and derivatives stored in `derivs_dict`. The `derivs_dict` should contain key-value pairs with the derivative names as keys and 1D numpy arrays as values.
The function should be able to handle any number of input data points and derivatives. The number of points and derivatives should not be hardcoded in the function and should be determined dynamically based on the input data passed to the function.
The keyword arguments for the `evaluate()` function should include the input data points and derivatives stored in `derivs_dict`. The input data points should be in the form of a list of 1D numpy arrays with the corresponding _data
