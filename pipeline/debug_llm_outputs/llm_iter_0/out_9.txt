Based on the provided dataset and taking into consideration the points from the exp_buffer, which implies that the simplest relations between du/dt and du/dx, d^2u/dx^2 (as well as their products and powers) don't provide a satisfying score, I will propose a slightly more complex structure incorporating the u variable. Specifically, we will test if du/dt is related to u and its derivatives with respect to x and t.

Let's implement the equation form as:
du/dt = u * (du/dx)^2 + (du/dx) * (d^2u/dt^2)

This form includes the second derivative with respect to time (d^2u/dt^2), du/dx and u. The use of these derivatives and the variable u itself is based on the data available, suggesting potentially non-linear relations between du/dt and spatial derivatives, as well the time dependence.
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = (params[0] * u * derivs_dict['du/dx']**2) + (params[1] * derivs_dict['du/dx'] * derivs_dict['d^2u/dt^2'])
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * (du/dx)**2 + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Remember that the equation is formulated to meet all given requirements. The given set can be vectorized and applied to arrays, which will result in improvement in execution performance when compared to using loops.
Moreover, note that the introduced 'd2u/dt^2'  reflects considering higher order derivatives with potential complex interactions and provides a comprehensive exploration of the interaction space between du/dt and other variables, which was implied to provide potential relationships of interest. 
Lastly, given that the interaction between spatial and temporal variables was seen as possible given the interactions between du/dx and d2u/dt2, this equation represents an attempt to evaluate these factors.

If this approach doesn't provide a satisfactory score, alternative forms might need to be explored, focusing for instance on the powers of du/dx or the interactions between du/dt, d2u/dt2 and u or du/dx.
