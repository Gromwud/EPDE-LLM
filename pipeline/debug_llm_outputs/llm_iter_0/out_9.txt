Given the provided data and the exploration buffer, I will suggest a new equation that has not been explored yet and meets the requirements. The new equation will be simpler to start with, and we can gradually move to more complex structures if needed.

Let's start by suggesting a new equation that involves the first-order derivative with respect to \( x \) and the second-order derivative with respect to \( x \), but in a different combination than what has been explored before.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * u"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation is a combination of the first-order derivative with respect to \( x \) and the second-order derivative with respect to \( x \) multiplied by \( u \). It is different from the previously explored equations in the `exp_buffer` and should provide a new perspective on the data.
