Given the input data and the existing equations in the `exp_buffer`, we can explore new forms of the equation that have not been tried yet. We will start with simpler structures and gradually move to more complex ones if necessary.

### Analysis
From the data, we observe that the derivatives `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2` are frequently used in the existing equations. We can try to explore interactions between these derivatives and the function `u` itself. We can also consider adding a term involving `d^3u/dx^3` to see if it improves the fit.

### New Equation
Let's try the following equation:
\[ \frac{du}{dt} = c[0] \cdot \frac{du}{dx} + c[1] \cdot u \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + c[2] \cdot \frac{d^3u}{dx^3} \]

### Implementation
Here is the implementation of the new equation in the format you specified:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^3u/dx^3"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * d^3u/dx^3"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

### Explanation
- **Terms**:
  - `c[0] * du/dx`: This term captures the linear relationship between `du/dt` and `du/dx`.
  - `c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2`: This term captures the interaction between `u` and its second spatial derivative.
  - `c[2] * d^3u/dx^3`: This term captures the effect of the third spatial derivative on `du/dt`.

- **Parameters**:
  - `params[0]`, `params[1]`, and `params[2]` are the coefficients that will be optimized to minimize the loss function.

- **String Form**:
  - The string form of the equation is provided to match the required format.

This equation is more complex than the ones in the `exp_buffer`, and it introduces a new term involving the third spatial derivative. This might help capture more intricate dynamics in the data.
