Considering the structure of the data and the buffer information provided, it seems that the only functions not explored yet involve t, or more complex interactions between the derivatives and u. Since we have information about t, u, du/dx, and d^2u/dx^2, I'll explore the dynamics involving these variables with the following equation:

du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * u * d^2u/dx^2

This structure will now include t and evaluate its possible role in the system. Let's construct the equation and return the string representation and the meaning of the coefficient parameters associated with the function:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * u * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * u * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
