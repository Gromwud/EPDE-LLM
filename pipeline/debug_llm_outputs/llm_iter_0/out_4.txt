Based on the constraints and the structure of the given data, I'd like to explore an equation that includes interactions between derivatives. Though the data points suggest a dependence on time and spatial coordinate \(x\), I propose to focus on the derivatives as instructed, looking for explicits interactions between them for now.

Here is my first suggested equation:

\[
\frac{du}{dt} = c[0] * \frac{du}{dx} + c[1] * \left(\frac{du}{dx}\right)^2 + c[2] * \frac{d^2u}{dx^2}
\]

Which can be translated into:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = (
        params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + 
        params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2 +
        params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    )
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = {params[0]} * du/dx + {params[1]} * (du/dx)**2 + {params[2]} * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation expands upon the simpler structure by integrating a quadratic term of \(du/dx\) and the second derivative with respect to space. It takes into account non-linear effects in the spatial variation of the function \(u(t, x)\), searching for the coupled nature of these interactions in guiding the system dynamics. Although this might be an appreciated complexity for some systems, remember that the goal is to find inexplicit interactions between the input variables, hence, the need to assess if such high-order terms or interactions indeed refine the predictions according to the available data.

The prior attempt with a similar structure in the 'exp_buffer' has been evaluated, but the score was 700, which indicates room for optimization (as the best possible score is 0). Thus, I assume this variant is not explicitly marked for further exploration in the current search, allowing us to include \(du/dx\) straightforwardly and assess if the weighted incorporation of \((du/dx)^2\) and \(d^2u/dx^2\) can better explain the data. Investigating the inclusion of higher powers or other types of interactions might be unnecessary if this enriched polynomial form fits better, thereby echoing the model building should generally be a gradual process from low-order to higher-order complexity.

Note that 'c[0]', 'c[1]', and 'c[2]' will be optimized by the fitting process and do not need to be assigned a preliminary value in the equation's definition; the 'params' array, populated with initial guesses, is responsible for their determination. 

The results of fitting this equation will feed into the evaluation score according to the guiding principles you've outlined, which we'll compare against the evaluation metric (score). After identifying this equation's score compared to the alternatives in 'exp_buffer', we can either doubly refine the prior attempt with a more precise structure or search along other unmarked equation forms to search for inexplicit variables interactions under different shapes of the equation skeleton.

If this equation does not perform well, it could imply overfitting or that such interactions are not explicits within this dataset, necessitating simpler or differently structured models. In either case, you'll receive valuable insight regarding the data's nature and how the equation should be adapted for the upcoming iterations.
