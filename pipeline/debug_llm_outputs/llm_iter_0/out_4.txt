Considering the vast amount of data points provided and the `exp_buffer` which contains previously attempted equations, it's essential to construct a new equation that takes into account the derivatives available and does not repeat the forms explored in the `exp_buffer`. We must also ensure that our proposed form adheres to all the guidelines set out, including the requirement for the equation to be dependent on at least one derivative for it to be valid. Given these conditions, one possible equation form could include `du/dx` (as it's a derivative referenced in the problem statement) as well as other potential factors that might influence `du/dt`, not directly replicated in the `exp_buffer`.

Incorporating `du/dx` and exploring the possibility of a multiplicative effect with other derivatives as suggested, a plausible equation could be:
`du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dt^2 * du/dx + c[2] * du/dt * (du/dx)**2`

A key aspect is ensuring this form isn't a copy or variation (like through complex transformations or multiplications) of forms already tested in `exp_buffer`. As "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * t", "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * t + c[2] * du/dt * du/dx", and "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2" have been explored, introducing `d^2u/dt^2` along with a non-recursive element, and a term that explicitly explores a derivative-to-derivative interaction (unlike direct multiplicative factors that were used previously) may further elucidate underlying patterns in the data, possibly revealing an equation of less complexity.

Here's how we functionize the equation:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dt^2 * du/dx + c[2] * du/dt * (du/dx)**2'
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This approach remains unique compared to previous attempts in that it directly addresses `du/dx` in a non-linear multiplicative context with `d^2u/dt^2`, examining potential exponential or higher-order derivative interactions, affirming the rules of incorporating at least one derivative in a non-recursive fashion not extensively replicated in the `exp_buffer`.
Incorporating `d^2u/dt^2` increases the scope beyond spatial influences, also inspects effective temporal element interactions `du/dx` could have with `du/dt` in a non-recursive modulation, indicating its potential novelty and reduced complexity relative to iterations solely emphasizing spatial interactions as `d^2u/dx^2`-based derivatives. It allows `du/dx` to have an effect modulated by `d^2u/dt^2` and amplification by `du/dt`'s interactions with `du/dx`, hypothetically elucidating patterns bypassed by prior equation structures.
