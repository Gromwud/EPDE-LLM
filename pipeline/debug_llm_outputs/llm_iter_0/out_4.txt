To determine a function that fits the data well and hasn't been previously explored based on the information in the `exp_buffer`, we need to formulate an equation from the data points given. Given the complexity and the lack of a clear indication from the data about what function could be suitable, we start with a simple hypothesis that involves higher-order derivatives (as suggested) and use the data's structure to our advantage. 

A possible hypothesis, since `du/dx` has not been effectively excluded as stated, and considering inputs are not necessarily entirely independent of the output as pointed out, could be an interaction involving at least `du/dx` and potentially `u` in relation to `du/dt`. To explore deeper interactions, we can also include `d^2u/dx^2`. 

As we are dealing with partial derivatives and we have information about `t` and `x` spatial coordinates, an extension of previous explored functions could add a new dimension by considering how the change in `u` relates to the shape of space `x` (signified here by `d^2u/dx^2`) plus how that change might be affected by `du/dx`. 

Here is a hypothesis of the form `du/dt = F`, where `F` is a function involving `du/dx`, `d^2u/dx^2`, and possibly `u` for its dependence but excluding `t` inputs as they are entirely implicit in the evaluation of the other variables (comment above suggested treating `t` and `x` variables with caution).

Here is the updated function:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]  
    string_form_of_the_equation = 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * du/dx'
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Notice that this function includes `du/dx` and an interaction term between `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2`. This structure has not been explored yet as per `exp_buffer`, and it respects the guidelines by using only the derivatives and evaluating `du/dt` as a linear combination of the input derivatives with coefficients from `params`. 

This equation seems to consider the magnitude of change according to `du/dx` at a given point `x`, but also account for the second derivative `d^2u/dx^2` multiplied by the first derivative `du/dx`. Considering these terms together could consider the magnitude of change according to `du/dx` and how the curvature `d^2u/dx^2` might influence the shape of that change. This structure thus uniquely combines different order derivatives in a novel way, providing a useful hypothesis for evaluating data structure.
