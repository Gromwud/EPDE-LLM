To explore the equation space and find a possible function that fits the given data, we should start with simpler structures and gradually move to more complex ones. Given the data and the `exp_buffer`, we can see that the equation `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx` has a score of 230, and `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx` has a score of 216. These scores indicate that the current equations are not fitting the data well, so we need to explore other forms of the equation.

Let's start by exploring a slightly more complex form that involves higher-order derivatives and interactions between the variables. One possible form to try is:

\[ \text{du/dt} = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2 \]

This form introduces a term involving the second derivative with respect to \( x \), which might capture some of the spatial variations in the data.

Here is the corresponding function:

```python
import numpy as np

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation is not in the `exp_buffer`, and it introduces a new term that might help in capturing the underlying dynamics of the system. The string form of the equation is also provided, and the number of parameters is 2, which matches the number of parameters used in the equation.
