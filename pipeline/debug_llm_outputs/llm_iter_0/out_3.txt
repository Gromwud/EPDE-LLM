Based on the input data and exploring the potential interactions between the variables and their derivatives, I suggest exploring an equation of the form:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * u + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2 # from c[0] and c[1]
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

In this form, the equation combines a first-order spatial derivative `du/dx` multiplied by the variable `u` and a second-order spatial derivative `d^2u/dx^2`. The multiplication of `du/dx` and `u` explores how changes in `u` and its spatial gradient may be interdependent. While the `d^2u/dx^2` term captures any curvature effects. This equation hasn't yet been seen in the `exp_buffer`, which records previously tried equations and their scores. The proposed equation includes `du/dx`, as required, alongside `d^2u/dx^2`. Note that `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2` are not actually multiplied. Instead, `du/dx` is multiplied by `u`, which are distinct operations. The result of those operations are then added.
