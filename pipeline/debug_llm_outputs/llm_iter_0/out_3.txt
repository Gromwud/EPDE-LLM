Based on the data given and the guidelines to consider, let's propose another equation that satisfies the given constraints and has not been explored in the `exp_buffer`.

To explore the space of equations, let's construct a hypothetical equation that involves `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2`, possibly in a way that isn't considered too simple or too complicate at this stage. Given the guideline to look at the `exp_buffer`, we see that we have simple linear relationships, the bilinear term (`du/dx * d^2u/dx^2`), and a quadratic term in `du/dx`. We can consider a more sophisticated form involving these terms, but also explore other hypothetical relationships; for instance, we can introduce an exponential term for the first derivative (exponentiation is allowed based on guidelines), which isn't listed in the structures we've tried before.

Let's explore an equation of the form:

`du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)**2 + c[2] * np.exp(du/dx) + c[3] * d^2u/dx^2`

To ensure the output is in the required string format, the equation should be simplified by opening all brackets (in this case, none are present), and the multiplication symbols should be explicitly used where implied by the order of operations and parentheses.

Here, `c[0]`, `c[1]`, `c[2]`, and `c[3]` are the parameters to be determined by the optimization procedure, and `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2` are derivatives extracted from `derivs_dict`.

An implementation of this equation for the function `equation_v1` as described in the problem statement would look something like this:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = (params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + 
                  params[1] * np.power(derivs_dict["du/dx"], 2) +
                  params[2] * np.exp(derivs_dict["du/dx"]) +
                  params[3] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"])
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)**2 + c[2] * exp(du/dx) + c[3] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 4
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation includes terms dependent on at least one derivative, and in compliance with the guidelines on constructing the string representation, uses no implicit multiplication, opens brackets where they might have naturally been used in a more traditional math equation representation, and uses only the notation allowed for the higher-order derivatives.
