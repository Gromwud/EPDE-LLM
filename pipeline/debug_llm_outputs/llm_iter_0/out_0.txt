Based on the data provided, the relationship between 'du/dt' and 'du/dx' appears to be linearly correlated. Therefore, a simple model for the equation might be:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

def loss_function(params, t, x, u, derivs_dict):
    u_pred, _, _ = equation_v1(t, x, u, derivs_dict, params)
    return np.mean((u_pred-derivs_dict["du/dt"])**2)
```

In this equation, du/dt is directly proportional to du/dx with a proportional constant 'c[0]'. This model allows for a proportional relationship between 'du/dt' and 'du/dx' that uses only one parameter 'c[0]'. To optimize this parameter, the scipy minimize function can be used with the 'BFGS' method to minimize the loss function that compares predicted 'du/dt' values to actual 'du/dt' values in the dataset.

This equation will be evaluated using the provided data and the optimized parameter that gives the lowest value for the loss function will ultimately determine the final model.
