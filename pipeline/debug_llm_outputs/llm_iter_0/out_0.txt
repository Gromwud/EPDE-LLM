Given the data from the points_set, a simple first-order relationship between the rate of change of u (du/dt) and the derivative of u w.r.t x (du/dx) emerges as a plausible fit.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    # Initial guess of 1.0 for the parameter 'c[0]'
    P = 1
    # Fitting du/dt = c[0] * du/dx
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Here, the parameter "c[0]" will be optimized using scipy's minimize function to minimize the squared difference between predicted du/dt (based on the derivative du/dx) and actual du/dt available in the data.

Use the evaluate function to get the score for this simple equation:

```python
score = evaluate({"inputs": [t, x, u], "derivs_dict": derivs_dict})
print(f'Score: {score}')  # Lower is better
```

It is important to note, however, that this simple relationship may not fit complex multi-variable dependencies in the data. Higher accuracy might be obtained by considering models with more parameters (e.g., du/dt = c[0]*du/dx + c[1]*d^2u/dx^2) or non-linear relationships (e.g., du/dt = c[0]*(du/dx)**2). But without prior knowledge or theory suggesting these relationships, the simplest case tested here is a valid starting point.
