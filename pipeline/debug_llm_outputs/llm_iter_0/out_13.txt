Given the input data and the exploration buffer, we can start by suggesting a new equation that has not been explored before and is simpler in structure. We will avoid using equations that have already been evaluated and focus on potential interactions between the derivatives and the dependent variable \( u \).

One possible equation to explore is:
\[ \frac{du}{dt} = c[0] \cdot \frac{du}{dx} + c[1] \cdot u \cdot \frac{du}{dx} + c[2] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} \]

This equation includes terms that have not been combined in the previously evaluated equations and introduces a new interaction term \( u \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \).

Here is the implementation of the suggested equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation introduces the interaction term \( u \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \) and includes the second derivative \( \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} \), which might capture more complex dynamics in the data. The parameters \( c[0] \), \( c[1] \), and \( c[2] \) will be optimized to fit the data.
