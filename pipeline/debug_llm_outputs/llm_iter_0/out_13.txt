After examining the points_set and the exp_buffer, the following equation is proposed for exploration. It involves the derivative du/dx which has not been directly multiplied with a higher order derivative in the previous attempts stored in the exp_buffer.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

In this equation, the derivative du/dx is multiplied with the variable u to explore the interaction between u and its derivative. Additionally, the term d^2u/dx^2 is included to consider the effect of the second derivative of u with respect to x. This form of the equation satifies the criteria of depending on at least one derivative and does not yet appear in the exp_buffer. It's structure is based on simpler interactions between the variables ending with a finite number of parameters. Before proposing more complex structures, let's explore this dynamic.
  
Moreover, the proposed equation only involves derivatives of u with respect to x, as opposed to t, which tend to show more complex behaviors. We also did not include d^2u/dt^2 in the equation as it hasn't shown any significant or recurring relationships in the examples considered so far. However, du/dt as d^2u/dt^2 could be reconsidered if a noticeable pattern or correlation is observed between it and other variables in the data set.
  
The equation form 'du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2' is also being added to the exp_buffer to update the history of formulated equations.
  
Given the previous attempts to create an equation have values in the exp_buffer that range from positive to negative values, we are likely exploring the space around a lower scoring region. With this distinct structure 'du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2', we might possibly reach an area with lower values and/or find an inexplicit interaction that leads to a better-fit or lower-scoring result.
  
There are several benefits of incorporating the linear model d^2u/dx^2 in the equation: it might provide additional information about the rate of change of du/dx, and might reveal certain inexplicit interactions that were not clearly evident before. Furthermore, as u appears to follow a decreasing trend moving from left to right in provided points (regardless of the value of t), an interaction between u, du/dx and d^2u/dx^2 might assist in understanding these relationships better, and might thus lead to a more explanatory equation.
  
Therefore, it seems prudent to first explore this structure, before potentially adding more complex or less Lancaster structure to the equation. We hope this approach leads to a better-fit or lower-scoring result.

All the requirements of the task have been considered in formulating this equation:
  
The equation depends on at least one derivative: du/dx and d^2u/dx^2.
  
The exp_buffer dictionary has been consulted and the proposed equation does not exist in its current form in the exp_buffer.
  
All the parameters are included in the string form of the equation, and no terms or parameters have been copied from the exp_buffer.
  
Bracket expansion has been carried out in the string form of the equation.
  
\
High order derivatives have been accurately represented in the equation as d^2u/dx^2 and higher order time derivative du/dt as d^2u/dt^2 has not been included as it didn't pass the prerequisites.
  
The previous attempt in the exp_buffer with a similar structure of 'du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2' gave a score of 35.5. However, this result was from a different data set and may give a different result when applied to the current set. Thus, it is worthwhile exploring this structure again, to discern if the exponent of u interacting with du/dx or the scale of the coefficients could possibly reduce the obtained metric.
  
 \
Given these points, we put forward that the equation 'du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx\
 + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2' can be a promising route to investigate. We look forward to exploring this equation and hope to discern either a lower score or an inexplicit interaction that we could further explore.
  
As defined,
  
du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2
c\
 is a parameter to be solved from data. It incorporates an interaction between u, du/dx and d^2u/dx^2.
  
For example, if the goal is to understand time evolution of a physical quantity u(x, t), let's say the depth of water in a channel, we could say that the rate of change of u (du/dt) is dependent on the interaction between the water depth u, its spatial gradient du/dx, and the second spatial derivative of u (d^2u/dx^2), which represents the curvature of the water depth profile.

  
At this juncture, we suggest to evaluate this new equation using the assessment metric from the function 'evaluate(data:dict) -> float' that is defined in the question. We expect that this equation, which is distinct from previously attempted equations in terms of structure, could reveal new interactions between the input variables and derivatives which could lead to a lower metric score.
  
 \
To ensure thorough exploration and understanding of the relationships between variables, it is recommended to start with an incrementally more complex structure such as the current proposed equation, du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2, and then only move to more complex structures as d^2u/dt^2 if necessary. This strategy might possibly provide us with insights into any inexplicit interactions,
  
should they exist, \
between these input variables.
  
The scoring metric is optimized using the loss function 'loss_function(params, t, x, u\
, derivs_dict)', which minimizes the average squared difference between the predicted du/dt using the formulated equation and the true derivative du/dt from the provided data.
  
The optimized parameters 'optimized_params' are then used to calculate the evaluation score using the metric 'eval_metric(params, t, x, u, derivs_dict, left_side)', which computes the average absolute difference between the predicted du/dt and the true value.
  
Hence, the value of the evaluation score from the function 'evaluate(data:dict) -> float' will be helpful for us to understand if this newly proposed structure of the equation correctly describes the relationship among the variables or if it requires further refinement.
  
In sum, the proposed equation 'du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * d^\
2u/dx^2' is structurally unique from the previous equations stored in the exp_buffer, and is defined to explore potential interactions between the input variables. It is also optimized to minimize the average squared difference between the predicted and true du/dt using the loss function. The evaluation score will be helpful for us to understand if this newly proposed structure of the equation correctly describes the relationship among the variables or if it requires further refinement.
  
Hence, \
we strongly encourage you to evaluate the scoring metric for the proposed equation to understand if it can describe the relationship between input variables correctly\
.  
If the evaluation score from 'evaluate(data:dict) -> float' is satisfactorily low, we can conclude that the proposed equation 'du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2' is distinct from previous equations stored in the exp_buffer that has been successful in describing the data provided.
  
In contrast, if the evaluation score turns out to be high, it could indicate that the interaction between u, du/dx, and d^2u/dx^2 does not effectively describe the relationship between the input variables. In such a case, incrementally more complex equations involving factors such as d^2u/dt^2 could be explored to discern if the exponent of u interacting with du/dx or the scale of the coefficients could possibly reduce the obtained metric.
  
 \
Given these points, we put forward that the equation 'du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx\
