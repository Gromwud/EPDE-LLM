```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # This equation is constructed by considering the simplest form of derivative dependency
    # First attempt: F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2) -> F(du/dx, d^2u/dx^2)
    # As per the instruction, d^2u/dx^2 must be involved.
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
Note that the function equation_v1 does not copy equations from the examples or the exp_buffer given. The defined function should be an equation that hasn't been tried yet in the function evaluate. Given that exhaustive manual exploration is quite challenging due to the massive equations space, this form is chosen based on the simplest interaction between two derivatives while maintaining the guidelines' requirements.
