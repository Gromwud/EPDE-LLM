Considering the data and the previous attempts indicated in the exp_buffer, we observe that the 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dt^2' derivatives alone are not sufficient to explain the relationship to 'du/dt'. Here, it appears that 'du/dx' might have a higher significance, and the equation density could be enhanced with other polynomial variations of 'du/dx'. 

With this in mind, let's introduce an interaction term between 'du/dx' and 'u', followed by a linear dependency on 't' and a constant term to further explore the potential dynamics. We will use the derivative term 'du/dx' along with 't' as the equation uses 't' in the form with u or its derivatives, which represents their implicit dependency.

To fit the equation's form, I'll suggest a function expressed as du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[3]. Here, 'c[0]*t*dudu/dx' explores the relationship between time, the spatial variation of 'u', and the horizontal gradient of 'u'. 'c[1] * u * du/dx' identifies the possible nonlinear interaction of 'u' with its spatial gradient. As 't', 'u', and 'du/dx' might not fully describe the behavior of 'du/dt', 'c[2] * d^2u/dx^2' considers the effect of the second spatial derivative of 'u', which could account for curvature information, and 'c[3]' acts as a baseline constant or offset to the equation.

Here is how to implement and utilize this equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    right_side += params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    right_side += params[3]
    
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[3]"
    len_of_params = 4
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
