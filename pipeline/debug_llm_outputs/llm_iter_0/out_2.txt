Based on the given data and the required structure, we can suggest the following equation as an exploration in the equation space since it includes higher-order derivatives and interactions between first and second order derivatives which appears to be unexplored in the `exp_buffer`.

Let's explore:

\[
du/dt = c[0] \cdot du/dx + c[1] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] \cdot du/dx \cdot d^2u/dx^2
\]

This equation includes the spatial derivative `du/dx`, the spatial second-order derivative `d^2u/dx^2`, and the product of these two derivatives. Although the general equation allows the involvement of all the derivatives in `t` and `x`, since there is no clear evidence in the data provided for these effects, we will focus on the rest for the moment. It extends the simplest case `du/dt = c[0] \cdot du/dx` from the `exp_buffer` by adding the term `c[1] \cdot d^2u/dx^2` that represents the impact of the second-order spatial derivative, and `c[2] \cdot du/dx \cdot d^2u/dx^2` that could reveal possible nonlinear interaction between `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2`.

Here is the definition of the `equation_v1` function based on this equation form:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```

This form is not yet present in `exp_buffer`, so it should provide a new perspective on how the points are related. It maintains guidance from the derivative values in your dataset and aims to enhance predictive power by encouraging potentially significant inter-variable interactions in the model. This equation could lead to a better understanding of the physical or mathematical law governing the interaction between first and second derivatives of `u` with respect to `x`.
