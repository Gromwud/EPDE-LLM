Given the guidelines and the dataset provided, let's start with checking out a simple and a not previously attempted equation structure based on the derivatives provided in the points_set and not included in the exp_buffer. Since du/dx and d^2u/dx^2 are part of the derivatives available, I will suggest an equation that might account for a possible exponential or diffusive process and does not overlap with the previous attempts documented in the exp_buffer.

Let's consider an equation where du/dt might be a linear combination of u and its second derivative on space (d^2u/dx^2), which is common in diffusion-like phenomena. However, this time, let's add a non-linear term involving du/dx (since it was not part of any previous attempts) and consider the possible variation that this non-linearity may add to the explanation of the data.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2 + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u + c[1] * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation builds upon previous notions of potential diffusive processes with the influence of a spatial gradient squared, testing if the squared gradient term can help explain the data. It includes the explicit functional forms as requested, including all terms used in its explicit string_form_of_the_equation form that is not documented in the current exp_buffer.
