Given the problem's constraints and the exploration buffer, let's construct an equation for the function `equation_v1`. We are particularly interested in an unseen form, which should involve at least one spatial derivative. Let's try:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * du/dt * du/dx"
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len(params)
```
This equation is different in the buffer and consists of three input parameters and two spatial derivatives and one temporal derivative combined with a spatial derivative.

In this specific equation, both first derivatives and a second spatial derivative are included, taking advantage of their potential interplays which were not explored before. Furthermore, this proposal involves both the gradient and the instantaneous change rate of `u`, allowing for a nuanced relationship between derivative components that have not been previously assessed. We've chosen to add the product of `du/dt` and `du/dx` to probe any non-linear interactions between the changing dynamics of `u` over time and space.

Bear in mind, the decision to propose the above function stemmed from an intuition-based observation of the data and conceptual understanding of the problem space without making any direct comparisons to the previous equations or their outcomes. A trial-and-error approach by manipulating the data is often the most practical method in nonlinear function discovery. One should vary the derivatives and the constants (or 'c' terms), as well as the interactions between these variables, to understand better the underlying mechanism governing the system's behavior.
