Given the input data and the exploration buffer, we will start by exploring a simpler structure for the equation. We will consider an equation that includes `du/dx` and `u` to see if it captures the dynamics better. Here is a possible equation to explore:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of-the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation includes both `du/dx` and `u`, which are dependent on `t` and `x` implicitly. We will evaluate this equation and see how it performs in terms of the score. If the score is not satisfactory, we can gradually move to more complex structures.
