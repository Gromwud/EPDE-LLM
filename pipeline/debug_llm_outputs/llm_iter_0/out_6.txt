Given the input data and the exploration buffer, I will suggest a new equation form that has not been previously evaluated and is dependent on at least one derivative. I will start with a simpler structure and then gradually move to more complex ones if necessary.

### Analysis:
1. The previous attempts have focused on combinations of `du/dx`, `u * d^2u/dx^2`, `d^2u/dt^2`, and `d^3u/dx^3`.
2. We have not yet explored interactions involving `d^2u/dt^2` and `d^3u/dx^3` in the same term or interactions involving `u` and `d^2u/dt^2`.

### Suggested Equation:
Let's explore an equation that involves `d^2u/dt^2` and `d^3u/dx^3` in a simple form, and also include a term with `u * d^2u/dt^2` to explore possible interactions.

### Equation Form:
```python
du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dt^2 + c[1] * u * d^2u/dt^2 + c[2] * d^3u/dx^3
```

### Python Code:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^3u/dx^3"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dt^2 + c[1] * u * d^2u/dt^2 + c[2] * d^3u/dx^3"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

### Explanation:
- The equation includes `d^2u/dt^2`, which is a second-order time derivative.
- It also includes `u * d^2u/dt^2`, which explores the interaction between the solution `u` and the second-order time derivative.
- Finally, it includes `d^3u/dx^3`, which is a third-order spatial derivative.

This form is not present in the `exp_buffer`, and it introduces a new structure that might capture the dynamics of the system in a different way.
