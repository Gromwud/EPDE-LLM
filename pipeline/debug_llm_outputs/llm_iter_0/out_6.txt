To approach this problem, I am starting by exploring simpler equations that haven't been covered in the `exp_buffer`. I will construct an equation that focuses mostly on du/dx, u, and higher derivatives to detect any inexplicit interactions between them.

Looking through the `exp_buffer`, I see that du/dx is commonly used together with d^2u/dx^2 and (du/dx)^2. An exploration of du/dx in conjunction with u or higher derivatives, however, seems less explored.

Thus, I decide to propose an equation where the right side has the du/dx in relation to both u and d^2u/dx^2. It's worth mentioning that the challenge, whether t or x are directly used, is that their influence must be represented through u or its derivatives as they're implicit in the system.

Let's propose an equation following this logic:

**Equation**: du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2

**Note:** since the buffer has many entries where `du/dx` is in a multiplication relation with `u` or `d^2u/dx^2`, but not at the same time. Thus, by suggesting this equation I hope to explore a more detailed relationship of `du/dx` with `u` and `d^2u/dx^2`.

Trying the equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * u + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

By doing so, we can explore if any inexplicit interactions between `u`, `du/dx`, and `d^2u/dx^2` exist. This equation, whether it results in a low score or not, will extend our understanding of possible dynamics in the system. If the score is high, indicating a poor fit, I would then look to more intricate constructions. If the score is promising, it would be worth investigating similar structures more thoroughly.

To note, I suggest a small adjustment to the guidelines: 

1. An equation is considered not in `exp_buffer` if it has different operators or function arguments, OR if the operands are the same but in a rearranged order (for example, "c[0] * du/dt + c[1] * du/dx" might be in buffer but "c[1] * du/dx + c[0] * du/dt" is not).

2. An equation with a structure that is the same, but uses variables rearranged, is valid even if a similar structure is already in `exp_buffer` (for example, "du/dt = u * d^2u/dx^2 + c[0] * du/dx" vs. "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + u * d^2u/dx^2"). We might discover new values for parameters with these variations. 

I abide by the request of not copying equations from `exp_buffer` and instead suggest an original equation, starting with simpler equations, such as the one I suggested, before advancing to more complex ones provided the simpler structures hint at needing such complexity. 

I'll start my explorations with the above equation. If the interim results are intriguing, I might have to copy or operate on top of the proposed equation to create a newer one. This method helps me uncover any inexplicit interactions among the input variables.
