```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * derivs_dict["du/dt"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * du/dt"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```
In this function, "du/dt" on the left side has been equated to a form that depends on the first and second order derivatives of "u" with respect to "x" and "t". This is a rather common form for a partial differential equation describing the behavior of a physical system in terms of its spatial and temporal gradients.
Given that the part "du/dx * d^2u/dt^2" was not included in the existing buffer, it might be interesting to examine its effect in the solution space. Du/dx represents the spatial gradient, while d^2u/dt^2 represents the acceleration, ie, the change in the temporal gradient. The interaction between them might represent a non-linear relationship between space and time gradients that could be relevant for the given dataset.
