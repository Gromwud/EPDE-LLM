Considering the data provided and the exploration buffer, there doesn't seem to be any simple derivative-based pattern that was explored yet. We could consider exploring different functional relationships that involve both 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2'. Since the data might have inexplicit interactions, it makes sense to consider higher order derivatives. 

The next equation could be:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 2 + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Again, remember that: 

* your goal is to find possible inexplicit interactions between derivatives;
* derivative-based patterns in 'du/dx' or 'd^2u/dx^2' might indicate the existence of such interactions;
* you're free to explore functions with higher complexity if necessary, but always start with simpler ones to build a base.
* whenever an equation is successfully recognized, it should cover at least one derivative ('du/dx' or 'd^2u/dx^2') to fulfill the requirement of the function's form; and
* your goal is to explore the equations' space (in relation to the score), and to examine any inexplicit interactions between the input variables, while staying true to the condition that 't' and 'x' can be involved in the function through 'u' and its derivatives.

Note: You might need to tune the values of the parameters 'c[0]' and 'c[1]' using an optimizer.
