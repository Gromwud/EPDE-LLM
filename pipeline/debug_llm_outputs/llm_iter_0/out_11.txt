Given the data and the exploration buffer, let's start by suggesting a new equation that hasn't been tried yet. We'll begin with a relatively simple structure but introduce some new interactions between the variables and their derivatives.

### Initial Observations:
- The data shows that the values of \( u \) and its derivatives vary across different \( t \) and \( x \) points.
- The previous attempts suggest that combinations involving \( \frac{du}{dx} \) and \( \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} \) have been explored, but we haven't seen much interaction with higher-order terms or other variables like \( t \) or \( x \).

### Simplified Equation Suggestion:
Let's try an equation that involves \( \frac{du}{dx} \) and \( \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} \), and also includes a term with \( u \) to explore interactions between the state variable and its derivatives.

### Equation Form:
\[ \frac{du}{dt} = c[0] \cdot \frac{du}{dx} + c[1] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + c[2] \cdot u \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \]

This equation is new and involves interactions that haven't been explicitly explored in the previous attempts.

### Output:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"] + params[2] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dt^2 + c[2] * u * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

### Explanation:
- \( c[0] \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \): This term captures the basic linear relationship between the time derivative and the spatial derivative.
- \( c[1] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} \): This term introduces the second derivative with respect to time, which might capture some temporal dynamics.
- \( c[2] \cdot u \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \): This term explores the interaction between the state variable \( u \) and its spatial derivative \( \frac{du}{dx} \).

By including these terms, we can potentially capture more complex behaviors and interactions in the data. This equation is simple enough to start with and can be refined further based on its performance.
