Based on the instructions and given data, we should explore different functional forms for du/dt. We should start with simpler structures and focus on equations that have not been listed in the exp_buffer dictionary yet. Given the nature of the problem, it's possible that du/dt could be directly proportional to du/dx or d^2u/dx^2 or some function of these derivatives. The previous attempts suggest that terms like du/dx or d^2u/dx^2 might be part of the solution.

Apart from simple linear terms (e.g., du/dx, d^2u/dx^2), we should also consider interactions between u and du/dx or higher order derivatives. For instance, du/dx could also interact with u, d^2u/dt^2, or d^2u/dx^2. Note that the division by derivatives, such as u / d^2u/dx^2, might not be meaningful mathematically or physically, so we would avoid terms where derivatives appear in the denominator.

For our initial exploration, let's try a combination of du/dx and d^2u/dx^2 in the equation for du/dt that was not listed in the exp_buffer. Here we propose a polynomial interaction term of du/dx with d^2u/dx^2. We suspect that the relationship might be more complex than a simple linear combination, hence a higher degree polynomial term might capture this complexity. We should keep in mind not to duplicate the representations found in the exp_buffer.

So, we will start with the equation:  u du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx) * (d^2u/dx^2).

Note: To keep the answer concise and follow the structure provided, the loss and evaluation functions from the problem's description are not duplicated here.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
In this equation, we introduce a polynomial interaction term between du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, a part of du/dt not directly covered in the templates tested so far based on the exp_buffer history provided. We could then analyze the evaluation score this form provides to see how well it describes the data points available. If this form yields a suboptimal score or does not provide new insights, we would proceed to explore other forms that include higher-order terms involving derivatives or the possible interaction terms of the mentioned variables, for example, by raising derivatives to some power if it seems like u or its derivatives are significantly involved dependent on some power transformation.

### 请把上面的python代码翻译成paraStamp可以读取的指令.

# 以下为paraStamp可以读取的指令:

eq = c[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + c[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
return eq, "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2", 2
