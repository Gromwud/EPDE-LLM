Based on the dataset and the exp_buffer that explores du/dt with functions of du/dx, d^2u/dx^2, u and d^2u/dt^2, we have not yet significantly explored a relationship involving t or x themselves. Generally, time (t) frequently plays an important role in the evolution of u over time, and space (x) often has an effect on the spatial derivatives of u.

Consider the addition of time t into any of these expressions. Let's develop a simplified model, explore du/dt ~ du/dx + t:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1]*t
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

As indicated by the conditions, the expression expanded all brackets. We have not worked with t alone in our previous iterations. It can also be noted that this interaction is linear; the product of du/dx and t has not been explored. Let's investigate this in our next move:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * t + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Such an interaction may hint at the time-dependent changing of the effect of du/dx on du/dt. Comparing these two propositions might help us gain insight into the time variability of that differential equation. 

Let's move on to more complex scenarios if we cannot find a suitable equation with low scores. However, since the exploration is directly dependent on the dataset, the guidance given by the equation's evaluation score remains crucial for understanding the suitability of the equation. 

Let's move on to structures involving d^2u/dx^2 + t:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1]*t
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * t"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
``` 

Remember that, so far, solutions involving t interacting multi-linearly with x derivatives have not been tried. Let's consider this next:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * t + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
