Given the last notation in the exp_buffer, a potential area for exploration could be one that involves higher-order derivatives of u, e.g., involving d^2u/dx^2. 

The provided forms in exp_buffer explored equations where the right side was a combination of the first derivative du/dx and the second derivative d^2u/dx^2 of u with respect to x. Considering this, we could look into interactions that could potentially arise when combining these terms in different arrangements.

So the exploration could go beyond just the linear combination of du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, and into something that involves their combination in a non-linear way. Following the hint that it is advised to include at least one derivative in the equation, we also have to consider not to forget the left-hand side of the equation which is the derivative of the function in time (du/dt).

This leads us to propose the next logical step where we try a more complex, non-linear combination of our previous best results.

**Proposed equation_v1 template:**
```
du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * du/dx * (d^2u/dx^2)^2
```

Our goal is to explore possible interactions between the second derivative (d^2u/dx^2) and the first derivative (du/dx) by squaring them and multiplying them with one another.

Note: don't forget to add the result of this exploration to the exp_buffer for future reference!

To have an operable all these expressions, they must be echoed back in the form of a python function with related code informed in it.

```
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2 + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * du/dx * (d^2u/dx^2)^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

As we move on, we ignore the unexplored variable (du/dt, t, x or u) as the examined equation so far didn't benefit from them, it seems they have a little interaction with the other variables.

**Important Note:**

The template in the provided settings code should be updated when a new equation is suggested. The right_side variable should reflect the proposed equation, while string_form_of_the_equation should contain a string representation of the equation and len_of_params should be the length of the params vector used in the equation.

Utilizing the entire data in construct_data, you can use the evaluate() function to see how accurate your proposed equation is according to the dataset we don't have access to. In this way, the truly optimal equation can be found systematically by exploring different structures across all these variables. The best score is when the evaluation metric is 0.
