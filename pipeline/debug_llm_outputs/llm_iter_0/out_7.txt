Based on the data and the exploration history in exp_buffer, several deductions can be made.

The equation forms that are already in the exp_buffer are:
1. du/dt = c[0]*t + c[1]*du/dx + c[2]*u -> score = 581
2. du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * du/dx * u -> score = 537
3. du/dt = c[0] * du/dx -> score = 537
4. du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dt^2 + c[1] * du/dx * u -> score = 316
5. du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * u * d^2u/dx^2 -> score = 240
6. du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 -> score = 38.9
7. du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[3] -> score = 37.1

From these results, it is noticeable that the inclusion of higher order derivatives such as d^2u/dx^2 does not significantly improve the score, given that both du/dt = c[0] * du/dx and du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * du/dx * u have the same score (although the evaluation methodology, represented by exp_buffer, is not clear). 

The same can be seen when comparing du/dt = c[0] * du/dx with du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dt^2 + c[1] * du/dx * u, which have scores of 537 and 316, respectively. From this, we may infer that the system is not significantly dependent on, or at least not described by, higher order derivatives.

Furthermore, when combining derivatives together (such as du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2), it is difficult to improve upon simpler visualizations (such as du/dt = c[0] * du/dx) due to the low score of 38.9.

Also, adding complexity by including multiple variables and unknown factors (like time t and charge u) does not yield noticeably better scores in the majority of cases (points 5 and 7 resulting in scores 240 and 37.1), indicating that higher complexity equations so far did not improve performance.

Taking these results into account, we will construct a new form of equation. The proposed equation is:

du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2

The string representation of this equation would be:

string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2"

Now, we can assemble this, keep in mind that to make the equation simpler, we should expand the expressions and simplify the equation, for example:

du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2

However, visual simplification is not required as we are dealing with computational form and not the human readable, but the more complex form includes division or multiplication of derivatives with the dependent variable (u), which is not directly represented in simpler forms, thus we'll use it.

Let's consider this as a functional math problem and create the equation in Python:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray) -> tuple:
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * t + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = len(params)  # or simply 2, as the code only utilizes two parameters
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation also is not present in the exp_buffer yet, which fulfills the given requirement.
