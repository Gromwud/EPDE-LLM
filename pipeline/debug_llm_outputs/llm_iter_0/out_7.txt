The data provided represents a discretized partial differential equation variant over time and space with its various derivatives, and there's an evident correlation among different points, hinting that a non-trivial relationship exists. Given that your target is to find the equation with the least score (best) without simply copying existing explorations found in the `exp_buffer` dictionary, and given that a proper exploration strategy considers simpler to more complex forms first, a logical starting point could be a simple combination of higher-order terms involving `du/dt`.

Here's a suggested equation that's not yet attempted, avoids the exact duplication of earlier outputs while exploring the simplicity to simplify finding the best equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This attempt explores the equation space, considering the involvement of both the first-order spatial derivative and the second-order temporal derivative which is not found in the provided buffer (indicative that this form was not previously attempted). The relationship between these rates of change offers a starting point to understand the diffusion-like behavior or potentially a combination of a wave-like component (given by the second-order time derivative).
