Given the input data and the exploration buffer, we will start by exploring simpler structures that have not been tried yet. Specifically, we can try to explore an equation that involves `du/dt` and `d^2u/dx^2`, which has not been included in the `exp_buffer` yet. This will help us understand if there is any significant interaction between these terms.

Here is the suggested equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation includes both the first and second derivatives of `u` with respect to `x`, which might capture some of the underlying dynamics of the system. We will evaluate this equation to see how it performs and whether it provides a better score compared to the existing attempts.
