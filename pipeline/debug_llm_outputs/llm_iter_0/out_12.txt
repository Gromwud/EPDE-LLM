The idea here is to provide a function that satisfies the requirements above using the minimal representation possible that includes at least one derivative as per the instructions, while introducing some possible interaction among the given inputs and derivatives, aimed to deliver a different formula than ones already in the exp_buffer.

Given that the system may involve physical phenomena, it is plausible to explore an interaction with Newtonian physics flavors such as proportional dynamics which may help in explaining the "velocity" of the system (du/dt) as an average of its current velocities (du/dx) with some disorting component of second derivative (d^2u/dx^2), scaled by the current state (u):

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0]*u*derivs_dict['du/dx'] + params[1]*derivs_dict['d^2u/dx^2'] + params[2]*u*derivs_dict['d^2u/dx^2']
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0]*u*du/dx + c[1]*d^2u/dx^2 + c[2]*u*d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation represents an expansion of the previously observed dynamics within the dataset space. The interpretation of the right part of the equation suggests three different effects: linear velocity of u with respect to x scaled by the state of u itself (u*du/dx), the acceleration of u with respect to x (d^2u/dx^2), plus the acceleration of u scaled not only by itself, but also by its displacement (u*d^2u/dx^2).

It's important to note that, above equation won't necessarily match the output data. This task, that is to optimize the parameters (c[0], c[1], c[2]) is handled by the 'evaluate()' function that uses scipy's optimization routine, that is minimize, to find values best suited for the given inputs and observed outputs, using 'loss_function()'. The score obtained by these parameters (and in this case equation) is returned by the 'evaluate()' function. If this score is the best among all other equations tried so far, this equation could then be considered as the winning candidate. If it's not, it signals that there are potentially better equations in the equation space that have yet to be explored. This function provides a hypothesis about the governing dynamics of the system that we're investigating as captured in the points_set data, aimed to deliver a different formula than ones already in the exp_buffer list. Error minimization based on this formula's results against the observed data could potentially provide insights and concise predictions about the system dynamics which may help in further analysis or planning aspects of it.
