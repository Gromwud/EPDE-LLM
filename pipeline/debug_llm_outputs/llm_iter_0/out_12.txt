Let's consider a function relating du/dt to du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, which also includes a time-dependent term. This is based on the fact that different processes have different importance throughout the time. Therefore, we can consider a funtion like du/dt = F(t)*du/dx + G(t)*d^2u/dx^2 + H(t)*u. However, to avoid a very complex and, possibly, over-fitted equation, we extract the time dependence to simpler terms, such as F = c[0]*t, G = c[1]*t^2, H = c[2]*t^3.

Let's also take into account the exp_buffer and choose terms that have not been previously analyzed, which in our case would be du/dx and d^2u/dx^2 from the derivaatives and the term of u.
In order to make these terms interact with each other and make the impacting variables (t, x) out of equation space, we let them interact through the parameters (i.e. times the parameters c[0], c[1], c[2]). 

Following this, the possible function can be illustrated as:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0]*derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1]*derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2]*u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * u"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
Please note that this is one possible equation. There are various other equations that could possibly describe the given points_set as well.
