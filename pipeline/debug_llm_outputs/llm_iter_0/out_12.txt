To explore the equation space and find a possible function that fits the given data, we will start by examining simpler structures and then gradually move to more complex ones. Given the data and the existing equations in the `exp_buffer`, we will avoid those that have already been evaluated and try to introduce new potential interactions.

From the provided data, it seems that the relationship between the derivatives and the function itself is quite intricate. Let's start by considering a combination of the first derivative with respect to \( x \) (`du/dx`) and the second derivative with respect to \( x \) (`d^2u/dx^2`), but in a slightly different form that hasn't been explored yet. Specifically, we will include a term that involves the product of `u` and `d^2u/dx^2`.

Here is a new equation structure to explore:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation introduces a new interaction term `u * d^2u/dx^2` that hasn't been explored in the `exp_buffer` previously. This term could capture some of the intricate relationships in the data that might not be captured by simpler structures.

Let's implement this and see how it performs.
