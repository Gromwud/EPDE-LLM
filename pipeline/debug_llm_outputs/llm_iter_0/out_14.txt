Based on the given input data and the exploration buffer, a possible function related to the given set of data points named 'points_set' can be suggested as follows:

The input data is of the form: 't x u du/dt du/dx d^2u/dt^2 d^2u/dx^2', and after exploring the equations space, a simplified structure is suggested as an alternative to already attempted equations.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

The suggested equation, "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u", makes use of the first order derivative, du/dx, along with the function u itself. This equation takes into account the possible interaction between the derivative and the function, which could give insight into the time evolution of the function u. Note that other higher order derivatives or additional terms involving time or space could potentially be included if the data and context suggest that they are relevant for the physics of the problem. However, based on the exploration of less complex expressions, the simplest form that includes different terms (besides du/dt which is the time evolution of our unknown) and has not been fully explored yet, du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx), it will be suggested as a simpler and related expression.

The suggested equation has two parameters, c[0] and c[1], which would need to be optimized using the minimize method from the scipy package to best fit the given points_set. This process would give optimal values for these parameters that minimize the mean squared error between the model's time derivative du/dt and its numerical approximation based on the given data points. Remember, your goal is to explore the equations space in relation to their scores and to examine any inexplicit interactions between the input variables.

The resulting equation in the python function takes in numpy arrays for t, x, u, and a dictionary 'derivs_dict' that contains first and second derivatives (du/dx and d^2u/dx^2) of u. It also requires an array of parameters that will be optimized by the minimize function. The right_side variable stores the computed equation value, and the function returns: right_side (computed equation), string_form_of_the_equation (equation as a simplified string), and len_of_params (number of parameters in the equation).
