Given the provided data and the exploration buffer, it's clear that the simplest forms involving only `du/dx` and combinations with `d^2u/dx^2` have already been explored. The next step is to explore more complex interactions between the variables and their derivatives. Since the values of `u`, `du/dx`, `d^2u/dx^2`, and `d^3u/dx^3` show some interesting patterns, let's try to include some of these higher-order terms and interactions in our equation.

One potential interaction to explore is the product of `du/dx` and `d^3u/dx^3`. This term might capture some of the nonlinear dynamics observed in the data. Additionally, we can include a linear term involving `d^2u/dt^2` to see if it improves the fit.

Here is the proposed equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^3u/dx^3"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^3u/dx^3 + c[2] * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation includes:
- A term involving the first spatial derivative `du/dx`.
- A term involving the third spatial derivative `d^3u/dx^3`.
- A term involving the second temporal derivative `d^2u/dt^2`.

These terms are chosen to explore the possibility of capturing both the spatial and temporal dynamics in the data, particularly focusing on the higher-order spatial derivative which might indicate some form of dispersion or diffusion. The second temporal derivative is included to account for any acceleration effects in the temporal evolution of `u`.

Let's see how this equation performs when evaluated.
