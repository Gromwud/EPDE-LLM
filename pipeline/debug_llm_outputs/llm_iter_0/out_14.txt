Given the provided data and the requirement that the equation must depend on at least one derivative, the interaction between variables, and the known operations that can be performed (like multiplication, addition, etc.), I will design a function that respects these requirements and is not present in the `exp_buffer`.

Let's consider a basic approach, building up from simpler to more complex formulations. An attempt could be to focus on combinations of `u` and its derivatives, considering that `t` and `x` effects might be coincidentally or implicitly captured by `u`.

One possible equation to try is:
\[
du/dt = c[0] * (u * d^2u/dx^2 + du/dx^2)
\]

The motivation being:
- Before looking at the buffer, we consider second-order derivatives in both space (`x`) and time (`t`), acknowledging that they could reflect the combined effects of `t` and `x`, which thus should not be included explicitly.
- We mix the multiplicative combinations of the dependent variable `u` with the space-driven second derivative (`d^2u/dx^2`) and the square of spatial derivative (`du/dx^2`), exploring potential overshoots or tensors in spatial dynamics that might be nonlinear.

Below is an implementation for the equation:

```python
# The function to implement the formula
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * (u * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + np.power(derivs_dict["du/dx"], 2))
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (u * d^2u/dx^2 + du/dx**2)"
    len_of_params = 1 # One parameter c[0] is being used
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Running the `evaluate` function with this equation could give us an indication of how its formulation relates to the variables in play and to the provided set of points. The function should now handle and output the `right_side`, the form of the equation, and the number of parameters that were utilized to define this equation. The equation has not been present in the buffer, and it is expected to provide insights into second-order interactions between `u` and its space derivatives.

Keep in mind that if the score is not significantly better than previous attempts, we might need to vary the structure or the terms considered â€“ for instance, by trying a different set of higher-order derivatives, exploring exponential or logarithmic effects, considering reciprocal derivatives, or looking into more complex interactions among all variables.
