Given the input data and the constraints specified by the problem, a possible function that adheres to the set of points named 'points_set' could be:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * u"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation is based on the assumption that the rate of change of u with respect to t (du/dt) can be expressed as a linear combination of u, the first derivative of u with respect to x (du/dx), and the second derivative of u with respect to x (d^2u/dx^2). This choice stems from the fact that higher derivative terms could be crucial for describing potential acceleration or curvature effects in the u function that depend on t and x, indirectly through u and its derivatives.

While this shape does not exactly match any from the exp_buffer, it is an extension of the several expressions found there ('du/dt = du/dx * d^2u/dx^2 + c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2', 'du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dt^2', 'du/dt = c[0] * u + c[1] * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2', 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u + c[2]') to try to address the possible complex behavior seen in the points_set data.

In examining the explicit interactions between the variables, the choice to not include terms like 'du/dt', 't' and 'x' in the equation directly is based on the observation that these variables' influence can often be represented through the function u and its derivatives. However, many other variables and their combinations can be included if the scores of the evaluated solutions have not yet produced sufficiently accurate results. In such cases, exploring the higher order derivatives or products of variables could be beneficial, even if they are not explicitly present in the currently provided data.

This solution meets the criteria of being a simplified equation in string form, dependent on at least one derivative, and without appearing in the exp_buffer. Therefore, adhering to the set of requirements specified by the problem.
