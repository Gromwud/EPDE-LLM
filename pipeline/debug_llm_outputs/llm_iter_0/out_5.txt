Based on the provided data and the requirement to avoid copying any equations from the buffer while still taking into account the derivatives' involvement, I propose the following equation structure:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation is not present in the exp_buffer and is a variation on the previous attempts, utilizing both the first and second derivatives of u with respect to x in a way not yet explored explicitly. The du/dx derivative is present in the equation, which fulfills the requirement. The involvement of the second derivative d^2u/dx^2 in the equation allows for the exploration of potential interactions between the first and second spatial derivatives of u. Additionally, including the first derivative multiplied by the second derivative (du/dx * d^2u/dx^2) provides an opportunity to analyze any inexplicit interactions that might not have been considered during previous attempts. This equation requires two fitting parameters which can be determined by the minimize function within the evaluation process.
