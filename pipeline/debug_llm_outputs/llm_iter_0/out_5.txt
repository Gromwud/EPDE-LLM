Given the input data and the existing equations in the `exp_buffer`, we need to explore new forms of the equation that have not been previously evaluated and are structurally different. Let's start by constructing a slightly more complex equation that involves a higher-order derivative and a non-linear term.

### New Equation Suggestion

We will explore an equation that includes the second derivative with respect to time and a non-linear term involving the first derivative with respect to \( x \):

\[ \frac{du}{dt} = c[0] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + c[1] \cdot \left( \frac{du}{dx} \right)^2 \]

### Python Function for the New Equation

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"] + params[1] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dt^2 + c[1] * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

### Explanation

1. **right_side**: The right-hand side of the equation is constructed using the second derivative with respect to time and the square of the first derivative with respect to \( x \).
2. **string_form_of_the_equation**: The equation is represented as a string for clarity.
3. **len_of_params**: The number of parameters required for the equation is 2 (c[0] and c[1]).

This equation is structurally different from the ones in the `exp_buffer` and introduces a non-linear term, which might capture some of the complex interactions in the data.
