To design a function that is not in the buffer and utilizes at least one derivative, let's consider the equation with the form `du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2)`. Given that we've seen linear combinations of `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2`, alongside `du/dx * d^2u/dx^2` interactions, let's explore more complex interactions involving higher-order derivatives because the dynamics of the system might involve them in ways not yet considered.

Let's design an equation that considers `du/dx`, combined with `d^2u/dx^2` and `d^2u/dt^2`, in a non-linear form. The simplest such form could be a product or division. However, based on the instruction to keep it simple and gradually increase complexity, let's first consider a more straightforward interaction that hasn't been explored yet, while also including `t` as the problem statement suggests that the input variables might express involvement through `u` and its derivatives.

One possible form could be: `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dt^2`.

This is a linear combination that introduces a multiplicative interaction between `t` and `d^2u/dx^2`, and also includes `d^2u/dt^2` as another independent term. This equation can help us explore the relationship between the spatial second derivative of `u` with time and the temporal second derivative of `u`, alongside the spatial gradient of `u`.

Now, to write this in the form requested:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict['du/dx'] + params[1] * t * derivs_dict['d^2u/dx^2'] + params[2] * derivs_dict['d^2u/dt^2']
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This approach respects the guidelines provided while exploring a new aspect of the equations space. It's important to keep in mind that this proposed equation should generate a new score when evaluated, and thus provide new insights into the dynamics of the process that generated the data in points_set.
