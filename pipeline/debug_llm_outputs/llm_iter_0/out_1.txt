```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This equation includes the first derivative of u with respect to x and the second derivative of u with respect to x, where the coefficients are parametrized as c[0] and c[1]. Note that this equation is not present in the exp_buffer, and it might help explore any inexplicit interactions between these input variables.
