Based on the provided dataset and the exploration buffer, let's suggest a slightly more complex equation than the ones already explored. We could include higher-order derivatives and products of derivatives with functions of u, t, and x to examine potential interactions between these variables. Additionally, considering that you want equations that depend on at least one derivative:

Let's explore an interaction between the second derivative of u with respect to t and the first derivative of u with respect to x, multiplied by u itselfâ€”this demonstrates the involvement of both independent variables (t and x) and boosts the equation's complexity:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * d^2u/dt^2 + c[1] * du/dx * u"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This function form incorporates a term not yet explored in the provided exploration buffer (exp_buffer), meets all the outlined requirements, and involves higher-order derivatives with respect to t and a cross-interaction term between u and its derivative du/dx. The parameters c[0] and c[1] will be optimized to best fit the data described by this form.
