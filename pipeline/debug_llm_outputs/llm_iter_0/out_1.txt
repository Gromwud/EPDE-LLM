Given the data and the exploration buffer, we can start by suggesting a new equation that involves some of the derivatives and possibly some nonlinear interactions. Since the buffer already contains a linear relationship between \( \frac{du}{dt} \) and \( \frac{du}{dx} \), we can try to introduce a more complex interaction involving \( u \) and its derivatives.

Let's start by considering a simple nonlinear term involving \( u \) and \( \frac{du}{dx} \). One such term could be \( u \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \). This introduces a multiplicative interaction between \( u \) and its spatial derivative.

Here is the suggested equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation includes a linear term \( \frac{du}{dx} \) and a nonlinear term \( u \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \). The coefficients \( c[0] \) and \( c[1] \) will be optimized to fit the data. If this equation does not perform well, we can gradually explore more complex interactions or include higher-order derivatives.
