Based on the given data and the exploration buffer, I'll propose an equation that is not yet tested, but still maintains a complexity that could potentially capture an underlying trend.

I'll suggest an equation that involves the multiplication of a constant with a derivative and a function of position ('x') and time ('t'), considering the experience buffer doesn't have any equation involving only an interaction between a derivative and 'x' and/or 't'. However, because the interaction with 'x' and 't' is somewhat indirectly expressed through 'u', I'll use 'u' in the equation as well, as required by the guidelines set.

Equation will be of the form:

`du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * x * u`

Please note that there are higher order derivatives present in the general equation but they have not been used in previous attempts. Unfortunately, while using the higher order derivatives would theoretically permit a more nuanced exploration of the function space, the equation space for these high-order derivatives has been yet to be explored. Thus, according to the guidelines, I will not include them in this initial attempt. Future attempts can include high-order derivatives as explorations once the simpler form equations have been sufficiently tested.

The function that corresponds to this equation is constructed below:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * x * u
    len_of_params = 1  # There is only one parameter in the equation (c[0]).
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * x * u"
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Just to be clear, in this equation, c[0] is used as a parameter that might take on the appropriate value to fit the data.

Let's also not forget that 'u' can be dependent on both 'x' and 't'. In this case, the equation tries to account for the influence of 'u' taking into account the relationship between 'x' and 'u', and the derivative 'du/dx'. This operation emulates the assumed involvement of 'x' and 't' in 'u'.

I hope this proposed equation aligns with the criteria provided in your request.
