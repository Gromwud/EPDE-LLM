Based on the input data and the exploration buffer provided, I will start by suggesting a simple equation that incorporates the derivative terms 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2' since these are present in several of the already explored options. We aim to understand how these terms interact with each other and potentially influence 'du/dt'. It is important that the equation we propose is not yet in the exploration buffer and adheres to the guidelines provided.

I propose the equation:
\[ du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * du/dx \]

This equation builds on the interaction between 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2' and allows for an additional linear scaling of 'du/dx', which has shown some positive results in the exploration buffer but not in the exact combination with 'du/dx * d^2u/dx^2'.

Here is the implementation of this equation, adhering to the guidelines:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This equation is designed to explore the potential non-linear interaction between the derivative terms 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2', in addition to their linear contributions. Given that 'du/dx' has appeared in successful previous attempts and interactions, it is reasonable to hypothesize that its product with 'd^2u/dx^2' may provide valuable insight into the underlying dynamics of 'du/dt'.
