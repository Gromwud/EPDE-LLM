Given the input data and the exploration buffer, let's start by suggesting a new equation that has not been previously tried and is relatively simple. We will focus on the involvement of the derivatives and the interactions between them.

One possible equation that has not been tried yet and involves the interaction between the first and second spatial derivatives is:

\[ \frac{du}{dt} = c[0] \cdot \frac{du}{dx} + c[1] \cdot \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \]

This equation includes a term with the product of the first and second spatial derivatives, which might capture some of the interactions that have not been explored yet.

Here's the implementation of this equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict, params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation is simpler than some of the previously tried ones but introduces a new interaction term that might help in capturing the dynamics of the system. The score of this equation can be evaluated using the provided `evaluate` function.
