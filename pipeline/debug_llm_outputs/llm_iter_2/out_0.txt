After analyzing the given data and taking into account the general form of the equation du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2), I propose a simplified model based on the observation that the data roughly suggests a linear relationship between du/dt and du/dx.

The proposed equation_v1 is as follows:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation models the system where the rate of change of u with respect to time (du/dt) is directly proportional to the spatial derivative of u (du/dx) with a constant of proportionality 'c[0]'. The function returns the actual right side of the equation, the string form of the equation, and the number of parameters used for this simplified model.

To achieve this function equation_v1, we observe that the relationship between du/dt and du/dx appears to be linear. This is suggested by the data where the values of du/dt and du/dx change together across different time and spatial points. Here's a simplified function where du/dt is approximated to be proportional with the coefficient denoted as c[0] to the spatial derivative (du/dx).

Please keep in mind that this is a simplified model and may not fully capture the underlying physics or dynamics of the system. To conclude, this function equation_v1 fairly examines the variation in 'du/dt' with 'du/dx' and provides a simplified yet anticipated outcome for the given dataset. This function equation_v1 will be valuable for forecasting and analyzing the behaviour of related systems. The parameters of the equation_v1 function need to be optimized using a loss minimization procedure for better approximations and these optimizations can be done at the place where the loss_function is called in the code. This function equation_v1 can be used to make predictions for unseen data or to simulate the system under various scenarios. For complex data recordings, this equation_v1 or similar can provide a simplified and computationally efficient way to understand the dynamics of the system. Despite its simplicity, it provides a good starting point for more detailed and complex analyses. As such it would provide a method for approximating du/dt for any given point which can be further refined to match with original data or complex system's behaviour with minimal calculations.
