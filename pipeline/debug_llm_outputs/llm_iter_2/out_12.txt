Based on the data and the given task, let's explore the equations space and generate a possible functional form that is not included in the exp_buffer. Given the form of the data, we can proceed with a general equation form that includes 'du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2)' and find a function that depends on at least one of these derivatives. Given the other instructions such as exploring from simpler structure to more complex structure and considering the inter-relations between the variable, hence we can frame an equation based on previously tried combination of the derivatives. The simplest form that is not in the buffer and does not violate the given instruction is: du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dt^2

Given the size of the parameter list and the instructions, we can proceed with only two parameters(c0, c1) for this approximation. Even though the general form du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2) can be quite complex and other interactions such as du/dt*t, du/dx^2, etc. do arise, exploring these would lead to an equation that is not in line with the requirements of this task for now.

Hence our suggested structure for the equation that has not been used before and considers the derivative is:

# Function that represents the proposed equation
```python

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # Define the form of the equation based on the given example
    right_side = params[0]*derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1]*derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```
Hence this equation form does not violate the given instruction and has not appeared in the explored buffer exp_buffer. It simplifies the more complex general form and makes use of the derivatives.
