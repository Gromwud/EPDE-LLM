Based on the given points_set and the exploration of the space of possible functions (given the set of rules and restrictions), I suggest the following equation as a new hypothesis: \(du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * d^2u/dx^2\).

For the equation to be different from those in the exp_buffer and comply with all requirements mentioned:

```python
import numpy as np

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict : dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Note: This equation is new and not present in exp_buffer and complies with the rest of the guidelines:
- The equation is dependent on the du/dx derivative.
- The value of len_of_params is accurate and equal to the number of params utilized in the equation (in this case 2).
- The final function equation_v1 is appropriately formatted. The string representation is simplified and brakets are expanded.
- The format of derivatives of orders >= 2 are correct (i.e., written as d^2u/dx^2, d^2u/dt^2).
