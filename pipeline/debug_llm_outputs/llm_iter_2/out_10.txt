Given the dataset and the instruction to explore the equation space in relation to their scores, I noticed that the current best score in the exp_buffer is 0.196, which was achieved by an equation that involves only 'du/dx' as the only derivative. From the dataset, I can see that 'du/dt' has a range from -0.49 to 0.5, while 'du/dx' ranges from -0.098 to 0.25. Considering these ranges, the direct linear correlation between 'du/dt' and 'du/dx' might not fully capture the underlying relationship. Therefore, my strategy is to explore non-linear interactions between 'du/dt', 'du/dx', and 'd^2u/dx^2'.

Let's construct an equation by making use of these derivatives in a non-linear form, including their powers and products, to maximally take advantage of the derivs_dict data. I will attempt to include 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2' as they may encode meaningful information about the spatio-temporal dynamics.

Given that we are allowed to use up to P=2 parameters for our constructed equation, let's create an equation that adds a non-linear component of 'du/dx' to an interaction term between 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2' to account for potential nonlinear spatio-temporal changes. Here is a suggested equation that maximally leverages the provided derivs_dict data:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # The proposed equation
    right_side = params[0] * ((derivs_dict['du/dx'] ** 2) + derivs_dict['du/dx'] * params[1] * derivs_dict['d^2u/dx^2'])
    
    # Since the parameters may need to be fitted from the given data to match the 'du/dt', we return the right side of the equation
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"

    # Returning the number of parameters used in the equation
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation was constructed in consideration of the dataset's range and is not present in the exp_buffer, which implies it's an untapped hypothesis that has the potential to explore a new area in the equation space. It has two parameters (allowing for fitting from the given data), and its 'du/dx' is assumed to be squared as well as multiplied by 'd^2u/dx^2', which could uncover potential non-linear interactions between the spatial derivatives which were not previously explored. The overall form of the right side of the equation and the string representation is simplified to ensure that there are no compound expressions and all the equations are open brackets explicitly.
