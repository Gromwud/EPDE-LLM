I looked at the exp_buffer and I noticed that the equations involving linear terms of u and its derivatives, as well as lower order derivatives, have been explored. Hence, I will suggest an equation that involves higher order terms and derivative interactions that is not yet in the exp_buffer.

Let's suggest an equation that includes combinations of higher order derivatives and derivative interactions, specifically containing the term (du/dx)**2, as the involvement of such term is interesting due to its non-linear nature and is not yet explored in the exp_buffer.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2 + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

In this version of the equation, 'du/dt' is expressed as a function of the square of the derivative 'du/dx' and the second derivative 'd^2u/dx^2'. This combines lower order and higher order terms to provide an equation structure that has not been considered yet in the exp_buffer.

The use of (du/dx)^2 and d^2u/dx^2 is aimed to examine any possible non-linear relationships between the derivative 'du/dx' and how this non-linearity affects the rate of change 'du/dt' over time and position. Given that the data suggests changes in 'u' with respect to 't' and 'x', the involvement of 'd^2u/dx^2' may also aides in explaining the second order changes in the function 'u' over position 'x'.
