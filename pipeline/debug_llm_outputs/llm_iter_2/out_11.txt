Let's analyze this problem for a simple structure first. Given the nature of our task, we should focus on equations that are dependent on at least one derivative. Let's start with the derivative `du/dx` because it appears to be one of the more commonly used terms in the equations in the exp_buffer.

The equation, 
```python
    du/dt = c[0] * du/dx
```
has a score of 537. This equation does not take `t`, `x` or any other derivatives into account. `du/dx` just seems to influence the change in `u` with respect to time. Let's see if we can improve on this by taking `t` into account. A simple modification could be something along the lines of:
```python
    du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx
```
which has a score of 494 according to the exp_buffer. This equation seems to work slightly better than the previous one, indicating that `t` does have some role to play in the system.

An alternative to this could be that `t` has a direct relationship with `du/dt`, rather than interacting with `du/dx`. Therefore, the equation could be:
```python
    du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * du/dx
```

This equation just adds `t` to the equation as a direct influence of `du/dt`. This conceptually makes sense, as changes in `u` over time would logically depend on time itself.

Next, consider if `du/dx` could have some non-linear behavior. A potential equation that could explore a quadratic interaction between `du/dx` could be:
```python
    du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2
```

Finally, consider if a combination of these could be a potential equation. The result could look something like:
```python
    du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * (du/dx)^2
```

Let's code this up and set up an equation_v1 function based on this:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t + params[1] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * (du/dx)^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Afterwards, we can evaluate the `equation_v1` function using the `evaluate` function. This will return a score for our new equation that we can then interpret in relation to the scores in the `exp_buffer`.

Please note that we limited ourselves only on derivative `du/dx` and `t`, without putting in mind `d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2`, for simplicity and brevity. When you go beyond more complicated structures, remember to include all the applicable variables in your equation_v1 function.
