In the given data, there are points that are very close to each other (up to zero) in terms of values of `t`, `x`, `u`, and `du/dt` but have a significant difference in `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2`. This indicates that the derivatives of `u` w.r.t `x` are contributing significantly to the change in `du/dt`. As such, we may think of building a model that incorporates the second derivative with respect to `x`.

Given the presence of points where `du/dt = 0` and significant terms in `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2`, considering these terms non-linearly might uncover some underlying, inexplicit relationship.

Taking `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2^` into the equation, we can explore a function of the form

\[
du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dx^2).
\]

We will start by considering the non-linear combination of `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2^`.

As `exp_buffer` does not have an equation with `du/dx` combined with `d^2u/dx^2^` in a non-linear way, we will add a term of this form. One possible equation could be

\[
du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx + d^2u/dx^2)^c[1],
\]

which notably meets the criteria of involving at least one of the derivatives of `u` and is not present in the `exp_buffer`.

Here we assume a non-linear combination of first and second derivative with respect to `x` with coefficients `c[0]` and exponent `c[1]`.

To meet the criteria and to adhere to the strict instruction, the equation will be expanded for calculation purpose however kept in a simplified form for the string representation.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    term = derivs_dict["du/dx"] + derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    right_side = params[0] * term**params[1]

    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx + d^2u/dx^2)^c[1]"

    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
