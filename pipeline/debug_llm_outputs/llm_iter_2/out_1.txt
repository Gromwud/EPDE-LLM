```python
import numpy as np

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dt + c[1] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2

    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

points_set is a massive set of data that contain 9 or 10 variables per point: t, x, u, du/dt, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, and d^2u/dx^2, and possibly 3 more variables t, x, u that are shifted in time. 

- For the sake of simplicity, we first code a solution that includes du/dt and du/dx to follow the rules given.
- By pursuing this structure, we allow for any interaction between the current du/dt value and the derivative of u relative to x. 
- The exp_buffer includes only one result with 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx' as result. So, we need to make a different equation, as an example, 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dt + c[1] * du/dx'. Herein, we explore how du/dt can be function of itself and it's derivative du/dx. 
- The function 'equation_v1' takes in variables and outputs the right side of our equation (i.e., 'right_side'), the string representation of that equation, and the number of parameters (i.e., 'len_of_params').

Please note that you should modify the equation in the 'equation_v1' function based on your hypothesis and exploration of the 'points_set'. Different combinations of the input variables would explain more features of the data set and lead to better results. You must also consider the instructions given in the notes. For instance, parametrization should always be reduced to simplest terms and should not be repeated from the 'exp_buffer'. 

You might figure out more suitable combinations while you explore the input data. The code implementation provided above can be seen as a preliminary guess under given rules and an example rather than the final output. Feel free to make more informed choices based on your understanding.
