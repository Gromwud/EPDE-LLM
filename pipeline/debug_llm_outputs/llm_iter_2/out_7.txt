Based on the provided data and the goal of exploring simpler structures before moving to more complex ones, we can suggest the equation involving the second order derivative with respect to x in combination with the derivative du/dx. This choice is driven by the fact that previous attempts didn't include the term du/dt on the right-hand side except in a suggested equation that scored 0.196, which might have been poorly evaluated due to the loop back nature of it.

Therefore, we can try a formulation where the right-hand side contains both du/dx and the second order derivative d^2u/dx^2. Given the last equation in the exp_buffer, "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2", we haven't explored a combination form involving both du/dx and du^2/dx^2. 

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] ** 2  # including the derivative of the first order and the square of the second order derivative
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (d^2u/dx^2)^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation introduces a higher order dyamic involving the second order derivative which we've not accounted for before. Should the dyerivatives of order n be insignificant, this form will result in smaller coefficients c[1]. This allows us to examine any potential non-linear interactions between du/dx and d^2u/dx^2. 

Please remember the intention is to carefully examine the parameter space while stepping through the calculations. It's important to be consistent with this approach to ensure robust and thorough evaluation. Remember, better scores can possibly be achieved by emerging more complex relationships in simpler structures, while keeping the overall number of parameters low.
 
Additionally, as recommended per the problem statement, all multiplications are explicitly shown and we avoid nesting brackets which simplifies the form of the equation. The c[0] * du/dx and c[1] * (d^2u/dx^2)^2 terms are presented separately to facilitate understanding of the dyerivative interaction components.
