Based on the provided data and the exploration of the equations space, an equation that has not been explored yet could be:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```

It is important to note that the use of du/dx, d^2u/dx^2, and d^2u/dt^2 is based on observing the data provided. If the 'exp_buffer' dictionary indicates that equations involving these derivatives have been explored but with high scores, then this equation is worth exploring further given its dependency on multiple derivatives and its unique structure within the provided pool of equations.
