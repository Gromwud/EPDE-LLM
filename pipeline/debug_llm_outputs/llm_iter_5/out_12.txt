Based on the provided data and the exploration buffer, we're looking for a function that may not have been explored yet and that could involve inexplicit interactions between the input variables. Here, we will consider an equation that is not linear in terms of the derivatives and includes the product of the first derivative and the second derivative with respect to x. One possible function is of the form: 

\[
du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 * d^2u/dx^2
\]

This equation is already in the exploration buffer, so we will consider another function that involves the product of the derivatives and introduces another variable, which could potentially relate to the equation through its influence on u or its derivatives. 

Thus, a possible function could be:

\[
du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * (du/dx) * d^2u/dt^2
\]

So here is the corresponding python function (equation_v1) with some explanation of what it does.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 2 * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dt^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 * d^2u/dx^2 + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dt^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
``` 

Derivs_dict contains all necessary derivatives, which are extracted in the function and used in the construction of the function based on our mathematical framework of the equation that we have constructed. 

The function then calculates the value of the function based on the chosen set of parameters (params) and returns this value, the string representation of the function (which follows the conventions you have provided), and the number of parameters, which is needed for the minimization process. 

Please replace the function name with equation_vN where N is the number of the current version of the equation you are working on. In this case, for instance, if you are working on your 7th attempt, you would replace equation_v1 with equation_v7.
