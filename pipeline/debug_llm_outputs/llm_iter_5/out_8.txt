Given the input data and the buffer for previous attempts, it seems like we have a chance to explore and suggest an equation that potentially hasn't been tried before. A look through the buffer reveals that we've experimented with terms involving \( du/dx \), \( (du/dx)^2 \), \( d^2u/dx^2 \), and the interactions between them, but the dependence on \( t \), \( x \), and higher time derivatives hasn't been thoroughly explored yet, especially in the context of how changes in \( u \) and its derivatives might be influenced by space and time directly.

Taking these points into consideration, I propose exploring the form that includes those variables that haven't been used in combination with one another. Specifically, it seems interesting to explore:

- The interaction between \( du/dx \) and \( t \) or \( x \)
- The presence of higher time derivatives like \( d^2u/dt^2 \)

However, given the generality of the equation form \( du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2) \), let's keep our exploration simple yet novel by including \( du/dx \) which we've established as a necessary element according to guidelines, along with potential less explored variables. Hence a suitable rendition of \( F \) could include:

1. The spatiotemporal derivative \( du/dx \) which we must include as per guidelines.
2. Since \( du/dx \) has been repeatedly examined, let's combine it with \( t \) to explore potential temporal influence on spatial gradients.

Now, to avoid reproducing the models seen in past attempts, consider adding a term involving \( t \) and taking out direct quadratic terms concerning \( du/dx \) or \( d^2u/dx^2 \).

Let's construct the function equation_v1, favoring a balance between simplicity and inquiry into potential spatiotemporal dependencies not yet thoroughly explored.

We postulate the following form, adhering to guidelines:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * t + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * t + c[1] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Here:

- \( du/dt \) is modeled through a mix of the spatial gradient \( du/dx \) related to time \( t \), which hasn't yet been explicitly explored (in the given form) in the given buffer.
- Besides, a strong dependence similar to past explorations is introduced through \( du/dx \) to ensure adherence to guidelines.

Consequently, with this operational form, we aim to unveil potential interactions between the spatial derivative \( du/dx \) and temporal variable \( t \) in a way that hasn't previously been assessed. The results from this novel approach may not only offer insight into the underlying dynamics but can also enrich our understanding of the equation's gap structure through this complex space exploration tailored by previous trials and conditions set forth in the guidelines.
