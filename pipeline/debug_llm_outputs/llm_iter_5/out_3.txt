Based on the data provided and taking into account the previous attempts stored in the exp_buffer, a possible function that might encapsulate the relationship within the data could be:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This eq. tries to explore the terms du/dx and (du/dx)^2, as it is clear that du/dx is part of the RHS due to requirement 3, and functions based only on du/dx or its second order derivative have already been tried. This function attempts to refine the already explored relationships by including a squared term of the first derivative, which would allow us to account for any non-linear relationship in the change of u with respect to x, something that the previous formulas did not contain. It doesn't immediately jump to higher complexity (involving 3rd order derivatives or non-derivative terms) as a simpler structure is desired for these cases. Note that if the relationship remains overly complicated with this equation, more complex structures can be explored whilst safeguarding against the known bad scores. However, I advise against the'HIGN' derivative (order 3 or higher) without a clear indication of necessity from the data. The variable t, x, u, du/dt are to be considered as implicit in the derivatives that are already part of our equation. Avoiding'HIGN' derivative would also reduce evaluation time and complexity. If results are still unsatisfactory, please consider higher order derivatives but keep a note on their effect of evaluation overhead.

Notably, variable t, x, u, du/dt are to be considered as implicit in the derivatives that are already part of our attempted equation, as made clear by the guidance provided in the input data to describe the structure of the equation. This is a strong indicator that trying to search for simple functional relationships as shown in this new function should be an adequate approach, at this stage of the optimization. However, there is no guarantee this will absolutely minimize the error as iterative improvements could still uncover new insights, even with terms du/dx and (du/dx)^2 used as the initial building blocks. Any further complications with the optimization must be met with progressively higher complexity, which, as noted above, may or may not be beneficial depending on the characteristics of the variables and the rate of error minimization per additional parameter. For instance, a faster learning rate would encourage higher complexity, whereas a lower learning rate would favour a more strict and less explorative approach. In general, higher complexity and more parameters also increase evaluation overhead, which should also be a consideration when evaluating the return on investment for adding more terms to what is already a fairly robust representation and modelling of the equation's right-hand side.
