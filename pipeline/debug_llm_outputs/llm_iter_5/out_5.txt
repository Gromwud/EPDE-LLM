Based on the data provided and the instructions given, let's explore an equation that includes the first and second derivatives concerning 'x' but let's also include the first derivative concerning 't'. Given that the existing buffer space has not explored this direction, let's suggest an equation 'du/dt = c[0]*du/dt + c[1]*(du/dx)**2 + c[2]*d^2u/dx^2'. The equation suggested involves the first derivative regarding both 't' and 'x', and the presence of the second derivative about 'x'.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dt"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2 + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dt + c[1] * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This equation was chosen considering the need as per provided guidelines:
1. Tries to use derivative terms that might be best suited for estimation from the data.
2. Ensures that the equation is not in the experimental buffer to avoid unnecessary re-evaluation.
3. Strives to be reasonably complex and different from currently explored equations.
4. Maintains simplicity and limitation to the set of derivative terms provided by the data.
