Based on the given data, it seems that there might be a relationship between the derivative du/dt and the spatial derivative du/dx, as well as higher-order derivatives. Keeping in mind that t and x are implicit in u and its spatial derivatives, I will explore a function involving du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, which are terms already present in the data.

Given that we've already tried the simple relationship between du/dt and du/dx, we can now attempt a more complex interaction between the gradients. One such relationship could be involving a product of du/dx and d^2u/dx^2.

To construct the equation, I will use the terms du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, along with constants to adjust the scale of their contributions to the derivative of interest du/dt.

Therefore, let's define:

\[
\text{du/dt} = c[0] * (\text{du/dx})^2 + c[1] * \text{du/dx} * \text{d}^2\text{u/dx}^2 + c[2] * \text{d}^2\text{u/dx}^2
\]

This equation is dependent on the spatial gradient (du/dx) and the second spatial derivative (d^2u/dx^2). It introduces quadratic and mixed terms to explore the complexity of the relationship while keeping it interpretable.

Here's the code for implementing this equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2 + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
The suggested equation is different from the given examples and meets all stated requirements. It is not present in the `exp_buffer`, introduces multiplication and power operations with the spatial derivatives, and includes a higher order derivative. It also adheres to the simplicity requirements by avoiding complex expressions where possible.
