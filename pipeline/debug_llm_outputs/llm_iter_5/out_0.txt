Based on my analysis of the given data, the function equation_v1 can be defined as follows:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):

    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt  = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2

    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

In the equation_v1 function, params[0] and params[1] represent the coefficients c[0] and c[1], respectively, in the equation form `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2`. I used the values from derivs_dict, which I believe represents the first and second derivatives of u with respect to x. The loss function and evaluate functions can use this equation_v1 function to train and evaluate the equation, respectively. The equation_v1 function returns the computed right_side, which is the value of `du/dt`, the string_form_of_the_equation as a descriptive string, and len_of_params as the number of coefficients in the equation. 

In this example, the `du/dx` and `d^2u/dx^2` values from derivs_dict are multiplied by the coefficients c[0] and c[1], respectively. This results in a simplified version of the general equation `du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2)`.

Please verify this function equation_v1 and let me know if there is any other information you would like me to provide.
