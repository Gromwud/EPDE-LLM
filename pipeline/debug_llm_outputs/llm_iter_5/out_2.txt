Given the points set and the exp_buffer, we notice that derivative terms are all present in the exp_buffer, hence the simplest equation that contains a derivative and not found in the buffer can be one involving the derivative 'du/dt', 'du/dx', 'd^2u/dx^2' and an exponentiation operation, something the previous attempts haven't explored yet.

Considering the need to involve at least one derivative and exploring the higher order derivatives, let's suggest an equation which is a function of "du/dx" raised to the power of two and multiplied by "d^2u/dx^2":

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2 * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)**2 * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This proposal honors the rules by constructing an equation that hasn't been used in the exploration yet and uses the existing derivatives in a way that hasn't been explored.
