This equation appears to not have appeared previously in the `exp_buffer` dict. Also, it explores the interaction between the first order derivative with respect to `x`, `du/dx` and the second order derivative with respect to `x`, `d^2u/dx^2` by multiplying them together and seeing if there is any inexplicit relationship between these two variables that can help describe the rate of change with time, `du/dt`. It also takes influence of these two derivatives independently by using two separate parameters for these derivatives.
