To tackle this problem, it is essential to first understand the nature of the points_set. The presence of higher-order derivatives and mixed derivatives provides an indication that the differential equation might not be of the simplest form. The equation_v1 should be constructed by understanding the relationships between 't', 'x', 'u', and all their derivatives. The current buffer indicates certain existing attempted equations with their corresponding scores.

Let's start by checking whether a linear relationship between du/dt and du/dx is valid, which has not been fully explored yet in the buffer. Given the nature of the points_set, it is necessary to check basic interactions before getting into complex ones.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # Assuming that du/dt could be modeled by a linear relationship with 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2', possibly influenced by 't'
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * t

    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 * t"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This function evaluates a possible form of the equation, accounting for both the first and second derivative of u with respect to x and their interaction with time ('t'). It seems quite simplistic but given the earlier attempts, it should be explored if it provides a different performance or reveals any new insights. If the buffer indicates that equations involving 'du/dx' linearly have been explored, this equation with 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2' takes this exploration a step further by also introducing 't'.

In case the buffer's best score with a similar structure equation (e.g., including both 'du/dx' and 'd^2u/dx^2') is too high relative to others or it's necessary to further detail potential non-linear relationships, next steps could involve introducing higher-order terms of 'du/dx' or 'd^2u/dx^2', or examining pairwise interactions of these variables potentially influenced by 't' and 'x'. However, with the information provided, this seems to be a logical next step for equation_v1 formulation.
