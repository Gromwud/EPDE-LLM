In the given problem, we are asked to construct a differential equation of the form du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dt^2, d^2u/dx^2) using the provided data points and the dictionary `exp_buffer` consisting of already tried models and their evaluation scores.

Considering the variety of terms and the equation's form in the `exp_buffer`, a novel equation structure to explore could be one that takes into account the cross-interaction between du/dx and the spatial second derivative (d^2u/dx^2) and also the linear term in du/dx. Using the given information and aiming for simplicity first, we can hypothetically construct the following equation:

```python
du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2
```

In the resultant equation, the role of du/dx is magnified by the cross-interaction term which implies that the spatial variation in the rate of change of u (du/dx) affects the change rate in time (du/dt), and the influence of this variation is further modulated by the spatial curvature (d^2u/dx^2). If c[1] is significantly non-zero, this may indicate an interesting interplay between the first and second spatial derivatives.

Here is how the implementation could look like for the suggested equation:

```python
P = 2  # Number of parameters in the equation

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = P
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
``` 

In this construct, we're adapting the complexity by keeping the interaction structure novel and non-linear. It can be anticipated that if there's a notable interaction between the u's gradient and curvature, the suggested equation might better reveal it. The simplicity in proposing 'du/dx' and the expressive power of adding 'du/dx * d^2u/dx^2' could lead to a more accurate representation of the data trends.

That being said, before we delve into testing this equation's stability using the 'evaluate' function, it's essential to ensure that such a model structure aligns with the system's physics and behavior. If the underlying mechanism embodies such a relationship between du/dx and its spatial curvature, then the provided equation structure could be insightful.
