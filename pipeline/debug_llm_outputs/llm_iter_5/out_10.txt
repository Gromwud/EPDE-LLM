Based on the provided data and taking into account the restrictions set by the exp_buffer, the following equation seems to suggest a possible relationship:

du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^3 + c[1] * du/dx

To not simply reiterate the equations from the exp_buffer, the interaction between du/dx and its power, as well as the linear influence of du/dx itself, are explored.

The final form of the suggested equation, taking into account the specific format requirements, is:

du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)**3 + c[1] * du/dx

Here is the Python function following the requirements:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"]**3) + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)**3 + c[1] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```
Note: The constants in this equation (i.e., c[0] and c[1]) will be determined through optimization based on the provided dataset.
